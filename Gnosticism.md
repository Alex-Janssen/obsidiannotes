# Gnosticism
## Background
Gnosticism was one of the most major doctrinal opponents to early Orthodox Christianity. It was a teaching based on divine knowledge: that revealed knowledge was the sole tool to deliver oneself from an impure, fallen, material world. Materiality was evil, possibly made by accident or by a malevolent deity, thus opposing Orthodox Christianity or [[Judaism]].  Eve, therefore, possibly played the role of wisdom alerting Adam to deeper knowledge. Christian texts were not meant to be read literally, but contained obscure meaning. The nature of [[Jesus]] was also disputed, he was possibly a spirit that seemed human, or a human embodied by a spirit.
Gnostic theology was deeply influenced by heterodox Jewish sects rather than just Christian texts.
## Gnostic Texts
As early Christians destroyed large amounts of Gnostic texts, few primary sources remain without a clear anti-Gnostic bias. Some Coptic-language scrolls were found, the Nag Hammadi collection, in Egypt. [[Alexandria]] was a hub of Gnostic thought, as it was a deeply diverse city with Jewish and Christian influences.
