# Anti-Rightist Campaign
## Hundred Flowers Campaign
During 1956-1957, the Hundred Flowers Campaign was a movement characterized by a push for greater intellectual and ideological freedom in China.  The name itself was taken from [[Chinese Communist Party]] slogans "Let a hundred flowers bloom together” and “Let a hundred schools of thought contend," allusions to hypocrisy in government.  This acceptance of freedom of thought became official CCP dogma, first dictated by [[Mao Zedong]] and formulated by the director of the Propaganda Department Lu Dingyi.  [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s [[Secret Speech]] and the [[Hungarian Revolution]] urged Mao to pay particular attention to the CCP's relationship with the people, as his denunciation of Stalin marked a sharp change in official ideology.  Intellectuals were initially reluctant to expand the scope of their research, and in 1957 Mao reaffirmed that the intellectual class was part of the working class and that confrontation was not necessarily antagonistic.  At the time, the CCP's main focus was combating the [[Three Evils]] of subjectivism (illogical dogmatic thinking), bureaucratism (a surplus of government control in the arts, sciences, etc.), and sectarianism (over-control of the CCP in all walks of life).  Some scholars saw these evils as caused by an abundance of control of the CCP over China, and wanted checks-and-balances along with impartial rule of law.

## Anti-Rightist Movement
As a response to this movement criticizing the CCP, this process of "blooming and contending" lasted for one month, and criticism was punished.  Mao launched the Anti-Rightist Movement on June 8, 1957.  Leaders of democratic parties and intellectuals were the primary targets, with up to 550,000 accused.  These "rightists" would be accused, lose their jobs, or even face exile and forced labor.  It must be noted that the vast majority critics accepted the party's rule and were mildly pushing for individual liberty.  In the 1970s, 99% of rightists were granted an reversal, although some high-profile cases were maintained.
