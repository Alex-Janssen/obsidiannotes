# China Undercover, Frontline
An estimated 2 million Chinese Muslims have been held in "vocational educational and training centers," or detention camps. Chinese calls can be alerted by certain words, and so some [[Uyghur|Uyghurs]] have developed codes to discuss sensitive subjects, i.e. the detentions occurring. Movement and journalism is strictly controlled in [[Xinjiang]]. [[Han Chinese]] are 40% of the population of Xinjiang, and are less controlled. Security in public places is substantially stricter for Uyghurs as well. 2009 riots against a police killing led to a substantial increase in security, with imprisonments and killings against Uyghurs occurring. Having a passport, relatives living abroad, and praying regularly are seen as factors that make "safe persons" suddenly unsafe, justifications for these 12,000 camps. This can be seen as the largest mass incarceration since the [[Holocaust]]. In Chinese media, they are portrayed as positive forces, with a person recorded as saying their "thoughts have improved a lot." 2 dozen Islamic sites were demolished in Xinjiang, and religion is surpressed in the public consciousness. Cameras are installed in front of houses. Kazakhs are also discriminated against, like Uyghurs. In 2017, the entire province submitted data, including voice, DNA, facial scans, which supports the technology. Han Chinese "relatives" are sent to Uyghur houses to get a biographic profile. Security cameras can even read facial expressions in data collection: only Uyghur faces are analyzed. The Xinjiang security model is exported to other areas of China, and possibly internationally. A large amount of technology companies, including [[Huawei]], work with this security apparatus. In December 2019, the Chinese government announced the release of everyone in detention camps, but this has not been verified or disproven. Some in the diaspora say that some have went from detention to labor camps.
