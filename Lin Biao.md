# Lin Biao
## Biography
Lin Biao was considered, like [[Deng Xiaoping]], one of [[Mao Zedong|Mao Zedong's]] preferred successors in the 1950's to 1960's, to the point that, in 1966, he was formally put as second-in-command, officially designated as Mao's "Comrade in Arms." Lin Biao's army background distanced him from the reformers in governments, and his youth made him a fervent Mao loyalist. He was a supporter of Mao's [[Cultural Revolution]]. However, by 1971, Mao started to distance himself from Lin. Mao feared usurpation, and, after Lin Biao's death in a plane crash in September 12 1971, Mao accused Lin Biao of plotting a coup. Lin Biao was blamed for many of the excesses of the [[Cultural Revolution]], with Mao blaming Deng Xiaoping's treatment during the affair on him in 1973. This morphed into the [[Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius]], a wider cultural and political reform project. He was also denounced by Mao's eventual successor, [[Hua Guofeng]], and even Deng Xiaoping would mask criticism of Maoism as critiques of Lin Biao and [[Jiang Qing]] instead.
