# Revisiting Chinese Political Culture, The Historical Politics Approach
Traditional modernizing, positivist narratives have argued that [[China]] will develop into a recognizably Western-democratic nation: this has failed. The Pacific Asian model of development has far more reliance on the state than the Western model, and thus development is brought on differently. With discrepancies such as these, historical politics seeks to bridge modernizing positivism with historical hermeneutic analyses in order to explain China on China's terms, less blinded by Western narratives and assumptions.
Progressive views of modernization see progress as convergence, while poly-chronic voices see the vectors of progress as parallel. Traditionally, authors have ignored China's culture as a reason for greater emphasis on stability and growth than freedoms, instead seeing it as a deficient case compared to a "full" Western democracy. [[Chinese Unification]] can be seen as the great quest in the arc of Chinese history, with dynastic turbulence generally leading to division and subsequent reunification. (World values survey results for Great Unification are suspect and weak, do not buy the argument, not huge, nothing about unification, and not enough evidence). Benevolence in, and respect for, rule and stability is promoted by [[Xunzi]], [[Mengzi]] and the wider[[Confucianism|Confucian]] tradition. By examining these historic trends alongside data, an independent narrative of China's rise can be built, leading to greater understanding of the contemporary nation.
