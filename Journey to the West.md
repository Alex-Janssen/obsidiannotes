# Journey to the West

### 1
###### Plot
A stone egg is produced on a magical mountain, from which a stone monkey is born.
The monkeys grow up, often visiting Buddhist sites.
The stone monkey goes into waterfall in order to become the "king" monkey, and finds an iron bridge and a tablet.
He led the other monkeys into the cave, and was proclaimed the monkey king.
The king cries in a banquet because they will die.
The king is told that Buddhas, Immortals, and Sages are not subject to hell, but that would require going to the human realm.
The king sets out to discover the secret to eternal life.
He successfuly sails to the human continent.  People are too interested in "fame and fortune" to know about Buddhas.
The king finds a cave with a man singing about the immortals, but he was a woodcutter.
The king wants the cutter to accompany him, but the cutter refuses as he would not earn a wage and thus couldn't take care of his mother.
The king finds another cave with an immortal boy, notable for an "empty mind."
The child opened the door as his master knew someone was trying to cultivate the way.
The master does not believe that the monkey crossed the ocean or that he doesn't have a surname due to being born from stone.
The monkey is called Sun, chosen for its character.  He will be called with the Dharma name Sun Wukong (awakened to emptiness).


##### Analysis
The novel begins with some sort of origin myth.
Every novel read so far, including [[Water Margin]] and [[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]], uses the first chapter as some sort of mythological framing device, with the Yellow Turban magicians and demons.
Life is made from stone, is that a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] idea?  [[Daoism|Daoist]]?
The monkeys seem to be the epitome of freedom, and the monkey king is upset for the future due to death.  There is no such thing as true freedom.
"Although we humans have rare delicacies to eat,  We are no happier than those monkeys in the mountains," an interesting take on desire not leading to happiness.
The woodcutter refuses for the king to call him an immortal, but the king recognizes him as one.  Virtue has nothing to do with class.
We see more synthesis between traditions, with the monkey king being very focused on [[Confucianism|Confucian]] filial piety.

##### Questions
Why does the book start with a moralistic lesson?  Why does it start with general facts?
Unlike other books, a substantial amount of plot is told in verse, why?
Why is the monkey king specifically a rhesus monkey?

##### Analysis
The murder of the bandits can be read as killing the human senses, a necessary involvement for attaining religiosity.
