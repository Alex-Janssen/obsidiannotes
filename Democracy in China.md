# Democracy in China
## Guiding Questions
How democratic is China?  
How do Chinese conceptions of democracy differ from Western ideas?
How have the Chinese people expressed themselves?

## Ideas
Both [[Mao Zedong]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]] have wrestled with the ideas of giving China more democratic power. Mao originated the [[Anti-Rightist Campaign]] as a reaction to the criticism he incited in the Hundred Flowers Campaign in 1957, and Deng helped crack down on dissidents in the process. Mao, however, created a culture of fear due to the [[Cultural Revolution]] and influence of [[Jiang Qing]], whose Gang of Four had control over propaganda and who advanced a radical form of [[Maoism]]. 
Deng Xiaoping and [[Hua Guofeng]], on the surface, tolerated much more dissent. [[Marshal Ye]] and Hu Yaobang both supported the Democracy Wall Movement, which allowed many of those disgruntled by the [[Cultural Revolution]] to seek redress. As this movement became more anti-[[Chinese Communist Party]], however, there were crackdowns on expression and leaders were arrested. Ye's Conference on Theoretic Principles was a space for intellectuals to openly advocate for more freedom of expression. Deng initially supported this, seeing little wrong with people speaking their minds, but later said that criticism of [[Marxism-Leninism]], [[Maoism]], the dictatorship of the proletariat, or the CCP was off limits. Deng Xiaoping, in his January 1980 speech, firmly denounced freedom of speech, assembly, press, and democrats in general as counter-revolutionary, all the while seemingly relenting to more American missionaries and journalists in his tour of America.
