# Is Chinese Culture Distinctive
In finding uniqueness, there are two main approaches, a positivistic, science based approach with falsifiable claims and interpretive, hermeneutic approaches. Hermeneutic approaches to finding uniqueness are inherently non-binary: the fact that there are two entities to compare means that there is some shared class, and we can describe at what level certain aspects are shared and others are not. Positivist approaches can only measure quantity, comparing percent of survey responses from one nation to another for instance (i.e. [[Hong Kong]] residents were not found to use [[Guanxi]] in politics via polls more than Westerners). Hemeneutic claims are often bolder, but lack distinct evidence. These approaches need to be combined, hermeneutic insight with positivist evidence, in order to provide a satisfying answer to the question.
