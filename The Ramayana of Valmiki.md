# The Ramayana of Valmiki
## Introduction
Scholars have argued that the Ramayana of Valmiki had one of the highest influences on culture (especially [[Hinduism]]) and thought of any work of fiction in world history. Valmiki's version is the oldest surviving version of this story of [[Rama]]. The story lacks psychological complexity emblematic of popular classic novels in the western consciousness: this one-sideness plays a crucial role in the novel's popularity.
## Nature and History
The Ramayana of Valmiki is an approximately 50,000 line poem about a prince, Rama. It is divided in 7 books each detailing a different point of his life. His exile and rescue of his wife are the central body of the narrative. The narrative has regional editions between north and south, but it is highly likely that all variations came from one source. 
## Story
### First book, Balakanda
The introduction contains meta-commentary of the origins of the poem itself. A king has four miraculous sons from three wives, blessed due to a [[Sacrifice in Hinduism|sacrifice]]. Rama is chosen to slay demons by a sage and is wedded along with his brothers.
### Second book, Ayodhyakanda
Rama is made prince regent in Ayodhya. People are jubilant, but a jealous wife of the king uses favors promised to let her child ascend and Rama is put to exile for fourteen years (similar blaming of women as [[Water Margin]]). Rama complies and his father dies of a broken heart. Bharata, the chosen king, refuses to comply with these morally incorrect orders, and goes to the forest to persuade Rama to rule. Bharata then was made to rule in Rama's name. Rama and Sita, his wife, move to the demon-infested forest Dandaka.
### Third book, Aranyakanda
This book focuses on the forest exile. Raksasas, demons, inhabit this forest. A demon tries to seduce the brothers and, failing, attempts to kill Sita. Rama fends off an attack from this demon's brother. Ravana, another brother, takes Sita by pretending to be a forest deer. Rama's vulture friend is killed trying to save Sita. This book is markedly more surreal than the previous and is more full of poetry.
### Fourth book, Kiskindhakanda
Kiskindha, a monkey citadel (reminders of [[Journey to the West]]), is the primary location of this book. They meet Hanuman, a monkey champion. Rama is sent to kill a pretender to the monkey throne in exchange for aid in finding Sita. Rama does so and monkeys fail to find Sita, but a vulture says that she is in Lanka. Hanuman himself volunteers to search for her.
### Fifth book, Sundarakanda
This book focuses on Hanuman in Lanka. The monkey leaps across the ocean and spies in the demon city. He finds Sita and offers to carry her to Rama, but she refuses, not wanting to be touched by a different man. She wishes for Rama himself to come to avenge her. Hanuman attacks the city, killing soldiers. He lets himself be captured and, when his tail is set on fire as punishment, leaps and burns the whole city.
### Sixth book, Yuddhakanda
This book is focused on the battle between Rama's and Ravana's forces. Ravana's brother joins Rama's forces. Monkeys build a bridge and, in the huge battle, Rama slays Ravana in single combat. Vibhisana, Ravana's brother, is installed in Lanka. Rama abuses Sita verbally and refuses to take her back as she stayed in the house of another man, but, by a trial-by-fire, is proven innocent and is reunited.
### Seventh book, Uttarakanda
The epilogue provides some narrative information and often unrelated myths. There is also a section on the later years of Rama and Sita, with his happiness short-lived. During Sita's trial by fire, ideas of Sida's infidelity with Ravana are spreading. Even though he knows the truth, he banishes pregnant Sita. Two bards appear during a horse sacrifice by Rama who read out the Ramayana. These bards are his and Sita's sons, sheltered by Valmiki, the author of this version of the poem. He calls for Sita, but Sita instead wishes for death. Rama, inconsolable, splits the kingdom between his sons and drowns himself, reuniting with [[Vishnu]].
