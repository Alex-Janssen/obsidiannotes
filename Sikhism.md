# Sikhism

## Guru Nanak
Although Guru Nanak is central to Sikh theology, his image does not play an outsized role in visual tradition. Sikhism, in general, is aniconic. Sikhism rejects the Murti image-worship of [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Jainism]]. Stories of Nanak's life are widespread, much like [[Hadiths]] in [[Islam]]: these are often illustrated. Nanak was illustrated in close proximity to Muslims often. In scripture, Digambara [[Jainism]] is decried, with Nanak shown being lavishly clothed. Nanak reaches out to religious figures of all denominations, a sign of active pluralism. His message was of complete equality between sexes, castes, creed, etc.. (Singh)

## Guru Granth Sahib
Guru Arjan (5th) compiled the Adi Granth, the first true Sikh holy text. Gobind Singh, the tenth guru, left no successor, thus the book and community (Guru Panth) took their role. The book is a compilation of writings by the five gurus, other hymn writers, and largely himself, with one hymn, the Sukhmani, being especially revered and used in morning prayer, the focus is supremely on the perfection of the name of god. Man sins inward and forgets the divine name, and only holding fast to it can save man. The way to know the divine is find a community devoted to do the same. Worldly concerns are nothing compared to holy ones, although holiness does not mean a renunciation of the family. (McLeod)
