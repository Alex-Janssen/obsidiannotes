# The Cuban Revolution, Origins, Course, Legacy
## Mediated Sovereignty, Monoculture, and Development
Cuban sugar monoculture (see [[El Ingenio]]) created a foreign-dominated economy, with the United States having majority interests in sugar until 1950. The dominance of US trade seemingly stamped out other potential industries, with some progress in the industrial sector. After [[World War 2]], [[Cuba]] had a burgeoning middle class still hampered by sugar dependence, with the cyclical economy devastating workers. In the 1950s, the role of sugar in Cuban economic development was seriously questioned.
Cuba was dependent on the US even while still a Spanish colony, with an 1890 favorable trade deal being an early marker. The[[Cuban War of Independence]] (1895-1898), however, devastated rural areas, sugar was only brought back in its old force with a new treaty in 1903. This reciprocity encouraged large plantations and monoculture. By the mid 1920s, Cuban capital only owned 1/5 of the harvest. The [[Great Depression]] devastated this economy, with output halving between 1926-1940. Between 1926-1950s, the Cuban economy was largely stagnant. 54.8% of GNP was foreign trade between 1945-1958, with imports declining in this same period. By the mid 1950s, it was clear that sugar was not an engine for future growth, but sugar was planted in over 50% of cultivated land and represented 1/3 of industry, with 23% of the workforce and 28% of GNP. After 1920s, Cubans gained majority interests in Cuban sugar, with 56% of production being owned by Cuban capital, but nationalization did not help change. Industrialists hoping for change never got true state support, however.
Simply put, Cuba was trapped because nothing more profitable was there. With global trade, sugar was a key good where Cuba had a comparative advantage. US import dependence weakened Cuban industry meanwhile. Political elites were corrupt, but spent enough on development and the creation of new government agencies that some outside the elite had the opportunity to accumulate capital. Between 1925-1929, local industry produced 40-45% of consumer goods consumed. The National Association of Cuban Industrialists was formed to protect industry and repeal the [[Platt Amendment]] alongside an anti-corruption and foreign land ownership platform. In 1927, the state supported non-sugar industries for the first time. Still, sugar was the only industry capable of raising capital for diversification. Economic development was seen as a precursor for an independent Cuba. With increased protectionism came increased industry and a slight decrease in national income per capita. However, in the late 1930s, US exports then began to rise again, favoring sugar again. During World War 2, diversification declined and domestic industry did along with it. In 1944, the ANIC convened a conference to try an take advantage of opportunities, focusing on state intervention in local industry, with widespread agreement on the need to boost productivity and less agreement on the issue of decreasing trade. The conference ended up asserting that trade policy has to promote the national interest. The [[World Bank]], along with the ANIC, thought that the problem was not too much sugar, but the lack of everything else. This consensus continued to grow, with knowledge that the US market had somewhat moved on from Cuban sugar. In 1950, the National Bank among other credit institutions were begun and the support for research and development blossomed. Creditors rarely invested in industry and agriculture and deficit spending meant that the government had less funds.
Before the 1920s, the government rarely involved itself with the economy, with the Machado administration in the mid 1920s regulating the sugar industry. In World War 2, Cuba deliberately sold under market prices, which was not reciprocated after the war by the US increasing prices, but threats of cessation of exports led to pro-Cuban terms. However, Cuba's reorientation away from US dependence was blocked, showing the limits of its sovereignty against America. Rice production increased, becoming a staple in the Cuban diet, but when it threatened to eclipse US imports the US threatened to decrease the sugar quota, which stopped Cuban banks from supporting rice cultivation. Between 1955-1959, the US Rice import returned to 1941 levels. The Batista administration seemingly was in the position to bring in reform, welcoming more domestic and foreign capital. The middle and lower-middle classes agitated against the status quo. Unionized workers in [[Havana]] also were not happy.
In the mid-1950s, 1/3 of the labor force did not have full-time jobs due to the sugar off-season, with unemployment reaching 20.7%. Rural Cubans wished for jobs more than land, with 69% wishing for state intervention. Cuba was not backward, but unequal. School enrollment rapidly increased until the mid-1920s, then saw a decline alongside literacy, recovering through the 1950s. The rural population had substantially higher rates of illiteracy versus the urban population (41.7% vs 11.6%). Cuban life expectancy was one of the highest, but many rural children had intestinal parasites and undernourishment. There was one hospital in rural Cuba. The Havana gap was larger than the rural-urban gap, with Havana being significantly more developed and had 50% of industry. 74% of 5-14 habaneros went to school, with 70% of university graduates living there. Places like [[Camagüey]] had particular regressions. Havana had a car import boom while the rest of the country was suffering: it was not Cuba. [[New York City]] advertisers ran ads in Havana newspapers.
Cuban feminism was an elite movement. They cared more about education and healthcare then the lives of working women, and, after universal suffrage in 1934 and endorsement in the 1940 constitution, most of the steam left the feminist movement. Women were 13% of the economically active population, lower than anywhere else in Latin America, partially due to the gap of jobs left by sugar. Working women earned substantially less then men despite being more likely to have an education.
In the mid 1950s, monoculture seemed to be dying. [[Tourism in Cuba]] began in earnest then, with cattle raising and vegetables changing the agricultural landscape. Entertainment and advertising firms worked with the US and some oil explorations turned up hope. There was hope for a [[Brazil]] or [[Mexico]] in the Caribbean. Elsewhere, development did not come with democracy, possibly resulting in junta. Cuba's foreign debt crisis mirrored that of other Latin American countries. Political support drove dependent development, but that fizzled while revolution did not.

## The First Republic
Pre-revolutionary histories analyzed Cuba as having a "first" and "second" republic. The first followed 1902 independence and ended in 1930 revolution, with the [[Platt Amendment]] allowing the US to intervene for its property, a clear violation of the island's sovereignty. The 1933 revolution brought fresh faces to society and [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] defanged the Platt Amendment.
The Cuban Republic was highly influenced by 1800s Criollo culture. Politics arrived in the infertile soil of Spanish colonialism. This criollo politics was formed by Madrid's laissez faire attitude toward Cuba, sugar and slavery, and the War of Independence. Cuba did not join the Latin American revolutions against Spain. Spain's reaction to the British capture of Havana deeply influenced culture. Cubans could hold local government offices, benefitting the habaneros, the only relevant population at the time. Arango was the chief proponent of liberalism post British occupation. Spain transferred mass funds from New Spain to Cuba between 1766 to 1806, allowing for sugar investment already bolstered by the [[Haitian Revolution]]. The criollos were constantly afraid of slave rebellion, and Spanish immigrants were a way to bolster the white population. In 1843-1844, an alleged conspiracy furthered this black peril. Slaves were thrashed to death, free men of color were sometimes executed or had property confiscated, and criollos opposed to this treatment were condemned. Sine the 1840s, many of the planter class wanted US annexation for democracy and limited abolition. During the [[American Civil War]], some Cuban slaves praised [[Abraham Lincoln]] saying that he was their hope. By 1895 Cubans had forged an idea of antiracism against Madrid. Cuba gained independence in 1895 from the East, with [[José Martí]] leading a broad front under the Cuban Revolutionary Party. The idea of Cuba Libre gained credence. The War of 1895 took 300,000 lives.
The explosion of the [[USS Maine]] caused the [[Spanish-American War]]. This was a great triumph for the US and helped Cuba become America's jewel. The American yellow press showed images of terrible poverty in order to agitate for peace. In 1897 there was stalemate, and then the US army broke through in five months. [[William McKinley]] did not entertain the idea of joint US-Cuban military expeditions, partially caused by blacks in the Cuban Liberation Army. Some Cubans were grateful, but the US did not give a date for exit from the country and aligned with the anti-radicals. Few of the heroes of the war survived it, with only Máximo Gómez. Marti both admired and feared America, and attempted to gain support in Cuban immigrant communities and US media. Don Tomas wished for a special US-Cuba relationship: of course only the US had the funds to rebuild the sugar industry after the war. The Platt Amendment was added in 1901 when the constitution was being written. Marti may have taken a more autonomous look, but he died to early to see his plans seen through. Cuba Libre united the whole country, a unity impossible to maintain after war.
Estrada Palma walked from Oriente to Havana in 1902, a triumph of liberation. This jubilation preceded bitterness toward the republic. He was greeted by mass crowds walking  from the far east to the capital. The journey was a testament to Cuba's respectable infrastructure linking rural regions to harbors for sugar production. People cried for Palma, Cuba, and the United States. Don Tomas promised that military rulers would never prevail over Cuba, and stated that the working people were the key of the country. [[Santiago de Cuba]] saw 40,000 mostly black people harass him nonstop, much to the chagrin of criollos. The 1901 Constitution let any male citizen, black or white, vote.
Cuban politics now is defined by an obsession with national sovereignty. The 1933 revolution was the foundation of this radical nationalism. After three decades, the 1901 government had no legitimacy. Cubans wished to see self-government, law, and good institutions. The Cuba Libre movement of 1878 led to racial reconciliation. A famous tome in 1888 claimed that all that was wrong in Cuba was due to being a Spanish colony. Consensus was rare to find and despotism was attractive, but Cuba had an inclusive electorate from the founding of the revolution. It never modernized or fell apart. A few key events showed the failure of the political elites of the country.
The new republic was, besides the Platt Amendment, in a reasonably good position. The treasury initial had a surplus and education and healthcare improved, with plenty of new roads being built. [[Don Tomás]] avoided partisanship in his rule. Estrada Palma rarely gave benefits or fund the army, and purged liberals from governments and added 150,000 names to voter roles. Estrada Palma was the lone candidate of the second election, with moderate, not liberal, rule. Cuba Libre civilians were not as popular as the military mambises. This was the first infraction against civismo. [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was reluctant to intervene. An American delegation lead by [[William Taft]] negotiated that everyone except the vice-president and president would resign and new elections would be held. Estrada Palma would have preferred US intervention to a liberal victory. His despotism caused irreparable harm to the republic, stopping alternation of power. As much as the Platt Amendment this student Cuban political growth. Liberals won in 1909 in a US overseen election, with a general Jose Miguel Gomez. Corruption was high level but others lower down benefited. Clientelism was rampant. The banning of the Independent Party of Color saw some blacks and mulattoes take up arms against the government for banning racially explicit parties. 2-5k died. Whites formed militias to keep rebellion in check. Menocal, from the conservative (rebranded from moderate) party won in 1914. He was especially close to the United States, corrupt, and not charismatic. A disputed election saw compromises between a popular liberal party and the incumbent conservative Menocal, but [[Woodrow Wilson]] supported Menocal outright after prior neutrality due to a possible rebellion, protecting a fraudulent election. Fraud, rebellion, and US Intervention were the levers of power.
Enoch Crowder, US general, saw the most direct US involvement so far in Cuban government from 1920-1922. During the 1920s, US-Cuba relations were fraught, as successive intervention did not bring stability and instead brought nationalism. Machado was a welcomed candidate, with Menocal accepting defeat. He favored Cuba but did not spook America, saw better education, but also used force against a union and student movement. Per-capita income decreased in his administration due to the sugar crisis of 1925. He then unveiled a mechanism to stay in power until 1935 without an election. This made Machado both supported and reviled by both parties. Meanwhile, the [[Mexican Revolution]] saw the foundation of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]], a system that guaranteed relative stability. Liberals were military aligned, conservatives civilian, thus partisan politics showed the deep civilian military division. Conservatives Palma and Menocal, Liberals Gomez, Zayas, and Macahdo were very similar in their lack of respect for democracy. Cooperativismo turned civilians against the government, but Machado was unpopular with both elites and the people.
Cuba was mobile and modernized since independence. Eventual abolition in 1886 bolstered Cuba Libre rather than aid Spanish colonialism. After independence, criollo control of sugar waned and foreign control waxed. Wage labor became more wanted while American and Spanish interests limited Cuban opportunity. Cuban labor striked dozens of times for better conditions, with tobacco workers playing a key role in independence. A work congress in 1914 wanted a minimum wage and Cuban-majority work forces, neither of which happened partially due to US opposition. The working class and students became more violent while the economy got worse. 200,000 workers struck in March 1930. 1902 saw the failure of elites to create a government pact, thus seeding revolution.
The US only actively involved itself in the crisis in 1933, having welcomed cooperativismo. FDR appointed an ambassador to mediate between Machado and responsible opposition. They wanted Machado to be removed alongside a new understanding of politics. Machado denounced the US and thought that the Cuban army might fire on US marines. The direct cause of the fall was the general strike which paralyzed Havana. Fulgencio Batista led a revolt of some officers against the officer corps. This, alongside military rebels and a student organization, formed a five-member executive with Ramon Grau San Martin as president and Antonio Guiteras as government minister. They revoked the Platt Amendment, and set a reformist, nationalist course. There was an eight hour working day, minimum wage laws, collective bargaining, suffrage for women. Despite this, Grau was compelled to resigned in four months. The Communist Party thought the government did not satisfy expectations. Officers wanted no compromise with sergeants. Strikes scared the US and wealthy Cubans, with soviets being formed in sugar mills forming 25% o the harvest. The US was reticent to accept Cuban sovereignty. In early October, deposed military officers attempted a coup, and in September a Havana Communist rally was disbanded. Colonel Batista collaborated with the US ambassador to remove Grau. Batista made the army in charge and himself as practical dictator. Gomez wished for the army to not control education and thus was impeached by a pro-Batista faction in 1936. Batista repressed demonstrations, including 3 over 200,000 people. The army assassinated Guiteras as he was attempting to leave. The wealthy supported Batista for bringing stability, but the working class had to be appeased, with the Communist Party allowed to pass labor reforms. He also adopted some reformist demands, like a National Bank and agricultural diversification. In 1940, elections were held and Batista won, thus a new governing pact was formed by the political elites alone.

## The Second Republic
During the 1940s, Cuba was a rare example of democracy in America. After [[Fulgencio Batista|Batista's]] 1952 coup, it was hard to believe that the stage was set for the [[Cuban Revolution]]. Neither the coup or revolution was inevitable. The political class failed to uphold constitutional democracy, and the trends that led to more stability in Latin American democracy by the late 1970s were not present in Cuba. Batista compelled unfair elections in 1954, which he won unopposed. Civic movements against the coup were fractured, and so Batista extinguished the flame of democracy.
The Constitution of 1940 remade democracy, allowing for labor rights, economic intervention, and private property. His early rule saw military influence wane and civilian power to become paramount to such an extent that a failed overthrow was planned in 1941. Batista gave power to the deposed Grau in 1944. This was Cuba without the Platt Amendment, albeit with sugar quotas tying Cuba to the US and sugar. Public officials saw the treasury as theirs to exploit. Graft does not prevent enrichment, but, in Cuba, corruption did not support development and entrenched sugar interests. State regulation of sugar led to yet more bribery, while non-sugar interests did not get corruption and reform to boost diversification. The working class had gained power in 1940, with the Central Organization of Cuban Trade Unions becoming entrenched in the constitution. Post 1933 unions mainly existed to safeguard employment. Unemployment was never decreased substantially, but employment was generally guaranteed once a worker had a job. 3/5 dismissal cases were ruled in favor of workers, and executive power compelled wage increases. Makeshift work became commonplace as a result of these unions, who entrenched antiquated, labor intensive production models. There were 70 paid, work-free days a year. Profits still rose during this time, albeit with rampant inflation as well. The executive often intervened in business to aid labor, and thus labor interests coincided with a strong executive. Capitalist interests deplored this labor preferential treatment. The government froze wages in 1948, which would have fallen due to lower sugar prices. Sugar mill owners had their difference in proceeds from higher prices seized in 1946. Industrialists still wished for good labor-management relations, hoping for a potential alliance with the communist-controlled unionists. Meanwhile, the clases economicas despised the union movement. Grau sought to remove communist leadership from the CTC, but was unable to. Grau instead worked with the communist CTC like Batista, and banned a second union in 1945. However, in 1946, the autentico party won such a large majority that supressing the communist movement could endear itself to both the economicas and the US. Non-CTC labor leaders often favored the autenticos against the CTC. In September of 1947, communists lost control of the labor movement, with leadership struggles weakening the organization.  Communists still had some influence over workers. Without unions, the party had lost a key mechanism of control for reform. Newer leaders were not less militant. Under communist influence, the CTC was relatively free from government influence, an autentico CTC was not. Cuban communists at the time were generally realists, wanting sweeping reform but not revolution. The PSP led unions were generally less corrupt as well. The 1940s saw autentico failure to solidify democracy and diversify the economy. The Grau administration expanded the budget in attempt to gain popularity. The ortodoxo party broke, espousing political reform with nationalism. Autenticos won in 1948, but Prio was not greeted with the same enthusiasm. Rent control, eviction bans, wage increases had boosted popularity, but unemployment and corruption made the populace suspicious. Prio was even more active in intervening in enterprises for the sake of labor. Interventions were a way for a company to sreamline operations, and thus were not unpopular by the clases economicas. Prio was closer to Cuban capitalists than either Batista or Grau. Violence in the late 1940s to early 1950s also served to weaken Prio. A young [[Fidel Castro]] was brought into politics by way of university government. Grupos de accion led to fear under the public. This led to a coup in 1952 with the demise of the compromise of 1940.
The coup was fully successful after two hours and sixteen minutes of its start. Prio saw how unable he was to resist and thus fled. Batista was advised to lead a coup in late 1951. Batista had military stature despite being predicted to come third in elections. Meanwhile, Castro was favored to win a congressional seat in Havana. Batista had democratic credentials by convening the constitutional assembly and giving up power in 1944. Upon gaining power, he raised soldier and teacher salaries, hoping for a rule much like [[Argentina|Argentina's]] [[Juan Perón]]. In the 1950s, Batista had become much richer than when his democratic credentials were formed, becoming lazy and hedonistic. Only in 1956 was opposition repressed. This coup was unexpected in the midst of an election race. The two main candidates were not provably corrupt. There was never any major opposition after 1952, but Batista also failed to gain unquestionable power. He called for new elections, implying that he was a transitional figure. Students and possible military opposition were threats. Repression initially was mild, wishing for popular support. Cuban political culture meant that violence against tyranny was not taboo. Ortodoxos often tried to assassinate him. In 1953, wider opposition occurred, with some trying to burn the Supreme Electoral Tribunal and a student was martyred. Students in the University of Havana continuously protested against the regime. Fidel Castro tried to lead a putsch in 1953. In 1954, possibly the most restrictive law on public order in Latin America was passed.
There were bombs in 1964 in Santiago before a presidential visit. Voter registration was skewed 7/1 for Batista supporters. In May, they removed Law 997, restoring civil liberties. A false election was held with Grau attempting to oppose Batista but he withdrew after an inability to produce a voter registration list. After this election, autenticos were allowed as a minority, and dialogue was comparatively open. Some renounced violence, as uprising failed. Students still felt betrayed by the political class. Batista announced political amnesty and return for exiles. Castro was among these prisoners. Castro expressed willingness to change tactics, but was unwilling to compromise with illegitimate governments. Radical students hated politics and wanted violence for overthrow. Castro re-went into exile, seeing no hope for pacifist struggle. Republican politics did not provide a model for removing a dictator or raising a new crop of politicians. Parties rejected the midterm elections for fear of legitimizing Batista's rule. The Friends of the Republic Society (SAR) was a broad opposition that called for dialogue, stating that Batista's coup was wrong but amnesty was a correct step. They were not a party, but a pressure group. People wanted democracy. When protesters died, thousands would mourn. Cuban civil society woke up. Some officials also dissented, paving the way for a negotiated solution. Batista was open to regular discussions with the opposition. Batista refused to compromise, however, and resistance dissipated. Some ortodoxos were unwilling to work with autenticos. Overall anger in 1955 could have led to democracy. Regular meetings led to infighting rather than a clarity of focus. Fidelistas gained support, but Castro was in exile without an army. Colonel Ramon Barquin rebelled against Batista, causing wider unrest among the military. In response, Batista censored media and suspended the constitution. In November 1956, fidelismo coincided with the death of Don Cosme, a negotiator. Granma's landing coincided with an uprising in Santiago. Castro, [[Che Guevara]], and other men reached southern Oriente. Batista killed 19 well known opponents in response.
Batista worked with unions, and unions were generally willing to work with different ideologies as long as concessions were made. The CTC was paramount in Havana but regional unions had power elsewhere. Havana was not the rest of Cuba, a polarization that was mirrored in labor. The July 26th movement was violent, trying to assassinate Batista in March 1957. There was a naval mutiny in [[Cienfuegos]]. [[Dwight Eisenhower]] imposed an arms embargo against Batista but did not encourage opposition. [[Raul Castro]] led a second guerrilla front. Meanwhile, Batista's preferred candidate won a pretend election. The army was used to urban insurrection, but not a rural one. The rebels, like Batista, had a skewed view. Much like Havana, the eastern-mountains were also strange. Military unity was more important over diversity, a future burden.
This armed insurrection brought down the Batista dictatorship and won the people's imagination. Castro was incessant on armed insurrection and had a clearer sense of purpose than other opposition figures. Moderates were incapable of ending the dictatorship. He was adamant about no foreign intervention and no merging between the rebel and regular army. Batista got lavish loan in his power while moderates opponents were denied even small ones. Batista lacked a loyal core leadership. He spent much of his time trying to buy military support and root out opponents. Batista was popular with the sugar oligarchs while unpopular with other industrial leaders. 
Since the 1930s Cuba's welfare state was beyond the mean of its economy. Autenticos and ortodoxos both supported further expansion, and Batista had to nominally support them. Some were fundamentally against capitalism, while others were reformists. "Traitors are those who favor midterm elections" was said by a splinter group from the ortodoxos. Politics never fomented support for democracy. Opposition leaders never wanted to be seen as cowards, thus there was a competition to be as aggressive as possible for fear of alienating more radical elements. "The republic cannot be redeemed with thieves" said Castro in Miami. A former senate leader warned of Fidel's growing influence, but too many wanted to be unique saviors that any wider opposition in favor of normalidad institucional was impossible.

## Revolution and Radical Nationalism, 1959-1961
Batista fled Cuba on New Year's Eve, and the revolution was welcomed by the people. Restoration of the Constitution was put on the backburner, and a socialist government which disallowed civil liberties, elections, or separation of powers was instead born. The clases populares were the centerpiece of the revolution, putting the former capitalist class, but the people could imagine Cuba without either. Many Cubans wished for justice and sovereignty more than democracy and liberties. Radicalization meant the ending of capitalism and a turn toward the [[Soviet Union]]. The [[Cold War]] animated polarization, but its heart was quintessentially Cuban. The new cabinet was an embodiment of liberal Cuba's best thinkers, but the Rebel Army's victories gave them as much power. Politicians wanted elections, rebels wanted revolution. Some wealthy Cubans supported the insurrection. Despite guarantees of private property and constitutional government, many moderates maintained reasonable doubt due to violence against large landowners unwilling to give supplies. Castro was an authoritarian as well. The revolutionaries spoke against reciprocity with the US and the monoculture. The main barrier to growth was lack of foresight. The [[26th of July Movement]] wished for national control over the economy. The upper classes were divided against the revolution and could not speak against it. Foreign and sugar-mill ownership of land was forbidden, with Cuban investments legislatively favored and sugar and Havana disadvantaged.  US exports to Cuba declined 35%. The revolution praised industrialists and diversifiers while condemning sugar oligarchs. [[Raul Castro]] commended comrade owners who met worker demands. The ANIC was welcomed into the revolution, supporting industrialization. A CTC-ANIC alliance could partially resist the PSP. Fidel's dismissal of elections did not concern the majority of Cubans. Nationalist reformers who wished for a multi-plural state were not welcomed. In 1959, Fidel affirmed that workers are always right, which scared industrialists as a clear sign of support for the clases populares.
The CTC was taken over by the July 26th Movement and PSP. These new leaders had less experience and were younger. Strikes were very common in 1959. Labor-management relations were made worse, while hampering the economy was seen as unpatriotic. Mediations generally favored workers. The Rebel Army also favored the lower classes. The PSP survived since its founding in 1939. Communist leaders originally hailed Batista, and also supported Grau. The 1947 CTC purge diminished its power, but the revolution brought it back in the forefront with allies and organization. The July 26th movement, however, purged party members from CTC power, determined to gain control of the unions. Strikes were harshly condemned, while the PSP tacitly supported them. The CTC was more popular thatn the PSP. Castro proclaimed "humanism," not socialism, as the revolution's ideology. Castro said that unemployment and economy were more important than salary increases. The November CTC Congress saw a boiling point in the conflict between the J26 and PSP. The congress sought racial integration and the elimination of unemployment alongside an increase to industry. PSP candidates were rejected. Castro wished for CTC unity, and by 1959 the trade unions were restrained. Development was more important than labor conditions. The PSP had ties to the USSR, making them a vital ally. Many rank and file workers opposed Castro's removal of powerful union leaders. The CTC accepted wage decreases and forbade splintering the "Cuban proletariat" linguistically. The popular living standards increased faster than any other Cuban government. There was no more capitalist economy, and unions kowtowed to the national revolution.
The government gained legitimacy from redemption of past indignities. In 1955, the US did not pressure Batista for elections. Castro saw elections as a slowing force on necessary reforms and radical transformation. Some J26 leaders wished to form a political party, but Castro was still not able to be challenged. Fidel inspired the national mission against Cubans without national dignity and the US. In June 1959, stores were closed while government stores were opened. The Organization of American States rebuked Cuba, possible forewarning intervention. Castro was against discrimination against women, especially in the workforce. Cuban women joined the revolution without a prior organization, unlike the CTC. Most Cuban women, like men, were not communists, but supported the revolution. In May 1960, Castro said that elections would not be called, stating that the people already voted for Fidel. During the 1940s, communists had some political control, albeit not owning any wealth or agitating any violence. [[Guatemala]] and [[Bolivia]] both had reformist governments that faltered due to compromise. The Federation of University Students, after conflict, allowed themselves to be guided by revolutionary direction. The Cuban political system became a one-party system. The US was reassured by the liberal cabinet but did not understand what was happening, and did not fully understand that the liberal cabinet, the US's only instrument of influence, had little power. US enterprises resisted wage demands and unionization, which caused nationalism. Fidel visited the US, and both sides may have accepted American aid, but the CIA stated that friendly relations with the Castro government was impossible. Air raids against cane fields and sabotage were tacitly supported by the US. An ally of [[Nikita Khrushchev]] visited Havana for a Soviet trade exhibition. US Cuba relations continued to deteriorate, with the island nationalizing American property. Before departing Eisenhower severed ties on January 1961. [[John F. Kennedy]] would dispatch 1300 Cuban exiles to overthrow Castro. However, he failed to grasp that the social revolution had historical roots and popular support. On April 16, Castro declared that the revolution was inherently socialist. Centralization of power alongside USSR support served a shield against the United States. By 1959, warming of relations was probably impossible. La patria, revolution, and Castro were merged, all or none. By the mid-1960s, Cuban jails had between 20-50k political prisoners, one per 425 inhabitants, the highest in the world. Castro stated that the perseverance of the revolution showed that ideals were more powerful than gold. This trinitarian conception of revolution was, however, flawed from the outset.

## Politics and Society, 1961-1970
Fidel Castro was the fulcrum of revolutionary politics, and thus the PSP, Directorate, and J26 Movement were brought together in a vanguard party, the [[Cuban Communist Party]], alongside the CTC and Federation of Cuban Women. They were unconvinced of the Soviet model, and socialism did not inspire the same enthusiasm of social revolution. Life was marked by austerity and a persistence to the monoculture. In 1966-1970, Cuba built both communism and socialism, hoping for a more balanced relationship with the USSR and an independent revolutionary model.
In 1961, membership in popular militias numbered 300,000, largely replacing the social role of trade unions. 300,000 volunteered for a literacy campaign, infused with military zeal. The masses followed Fidel with confidence and conviction, and socialism was the model of the working class. Routinization of politics was suspect, normal times did not lead to social revolution.
The 1959-1960 rebels restrained all organizations against the revolution. The Soviet bloc showed how effective a vanguard party was in retaining power after revolution, a natural component of a planned economy. [[José Martí]] advocated for a vanguard as well to advance popular interests. The PSP was the only party able to organize the new party. Fidel criticized the Integrated Revolutionary Organization's leadership, saying they were sectarian and abused authority. By 1965, there was a vanguard organization, but gained legitimacy from the revolution rather than the other way around.
In 1959, the government had tight control over unions, disavowing the right or need to strike. Workers were encouraged to not sacrifice tomorrow for today. Guevara commented that participation in elections was poor, and the working class was unable to adequately pick leaders for itself. Labor often worked with government. At the end of 1961, 200,000 Cubans were unemployed, leading to further repudiation of union demands. Some historical benefits remained while others were rescinded. Cuban workers were expected to collaborate. Worker assemblies were often led by managers. Grievance commissions settled conflicts between labor and management between 1961-1964, but scarcely favored management. Castro was displeased at this, accusing them of supporting absenteeism and vagrancy. Daily life showed the disunity of socialism. Workers were never fully trusted and unions were not free, thus showing a false socialism. Most workers supported the revolution in the early 1960s, with workers expecting fair treatment from the government. New forms of economic organization would form new social relations, with more advanced forms leading in a more advanced level of development. Weak institutions could not check centralized power, and corruption was on the rise in the early 1960s. Trade unions did not fare so badly considering their fate later in the decade, with 1961-1965 being a sort of golden era. Limited autonomy was better than none.
The FMC, Federation of Cuban Women, was much less divided. As women had been politically inactive before, their political foundation was the revolution, with the FMC training women in trades and first aid training. Women began to hold administration positions, but held less labor force percentage in the 1960s than a decade earlier. Cadres readily passed down orders instead of promoting discussion.
The [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] of 1961 failed in two days, which led [[John F. Kennedy]] to organize covert actions. Their goal was the overthrow of the Cuban revolutionary government. In 1962, Soviet nuclear missiles were placed in Cuba, causing the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]]. European governments would not have reacted well to paranoia, seeing that they were already inside Soviet missile range. JFK valued a free West Berlin more than a free Cuba. Eventually, the USSR removed missiles in exchange for no invasion, which Khrushchev did not relay to Cuba before, treating Fidel like a pawn. Between 1960-1966, some guerillas posed a threat to the government. These pro-US rebels numbered around 8,000 and never got significant American support. By the early 1960s, patriotism meant loyalty and the elimination of private property was seen as necessary for social justice. Cuba replaced dependence on Washington with Moscow.
The revolution was optimistic, calling for modernization. Socialism should have allowed for good economic policies in this regard. Cuba tried to tie itself to Scandinavia, calling itself an imperfectly developed nation. The Commerce Department did not consider Cuba underdeveloped, and the J26 Movement believed in a wealth nation. Guevara hoped for GDP per capita to surpass the US's. The early revolutionary government oversaw a good economy and oversaw a 2 year plan of more diversification financed with USSR loans and lack of luxury imports. This failed. Sugar output declined and diversification did not raise funds or satisfy domestic demand. In 1964, sugar then became king again due to comparative advantage. State bureaucracy expanded, dulling the people's spirit, which was eventually combatted by the party for fear of a parasitic class. Former bureaucrats were called to work in agriculture. The USSR was also less powerful and respectful of Cuban sovereignty than appeared at first glance, and so a lessened dependence was sought.
New Communists came to dominate the PCC, which came to reject communist dogmas. It rejected Soviet leadership, and Fidel proclaimed the need for more revolution. Guevara left Cuba to foment revolution elsewhere. The PCC oversaw local power elections. Bureaucrats were sent to production on mass, with tens of thousands of jobs lost, mostly in Havana. Taxes and interest rates were abolished, as the National Bank could not manage the economy. Budgets and plans were abolished, instead mini-plans were made. Wages did not follow productivity, and incomes were meant to be equal for all workers. This revolution was extreme egalitarian and against administration. Fidel believed that, even without documentation, an increase of production would be a strict good.
Trade unions were seen as another outgrowth of bureaucracy, an unproductive institution. The resource of the party was the energy of the people. Fidel wanted manuals to be cast aside and for common sense to prevail. Vanguard workers were called to sacrifice, while average workers were demoralized. 25-50% of the work day was non-productive. The FMC continued to have success, still, while still not expressing an idea of feminism.
The revolution of the late 1960s was that of creating a Cuban face of socialism. Producing a 10-million-ton harvest was not an economic goal, it was a yardstick for the revolution. Failure would have meant lack of revolution: it failed. In 1967, Guevara died in Bolivia, showing a failure of Cuba's plan to export revolution. Dissent was not allowed. The USSR's fuel shipment delay highlighted that Cuba was not fully independent. On August 323, 1968, the USSR led the [[Soviet Invasion of Czechoslovakia]], a reaction to their market reforms. Cuba nominally support the invasion of the Czechoslovaks, easing a tensing relationship with the USSR.
Hundreds of thousands of Cubans wasted the working day for their own interests, with hippies fully present. Bars and vacations would be postponed until a great harvest. Corner stands selling coffee disappeared. All manor of small private business were axed and private consumption dipped below 1962 levels, a sign of economic collapse. Fidel acknowledged the crisis but claimed that the only way through was communism. He offered to resign, which was rejected. PCC cadres were uneducated, 80% not having graduated sixth grade. Education was necessary and absenteeism was like striking. No matter the number of bureaucrats fired, bureaucratic rule remained. Fidel stated that the vanguard must learn from the workers, but still maintained the right to rule.
Cuba's failed harvest meant that there was no Cuban face for socialism, and that institutionalization was necessary. Cuba needed the Soviet model. Thus, in 1970, the revolution ended. Socialist reality overwhelmed revolutionary optimism.

## Politics and Society, 1971-1986
Institutionalization gave Cuban socialism a familiar characteristic. Three congresses were held in the decade between 1975-1986. The CTC and Women's Federation held congresses too. Few sectoral interest could be expressed. Under PCC control, some voting was allowed within Cuban socialism. They hoped for closer ties with the Soviets, which was also affected by changes in Latin America and Africa. Diplomatic relations supplanted guerrilla movements in dealing with Latin America, and Cuba intervened in [[Angola]] during the [[Angolan Civil War]] and [[Ethiopia]]. Even US-Cuban relations seemed to be improving.
Without institutions, public officials had impunity and work was not done. Castro accepted the reality of institutionalization, albeit without the same zeal he took with the radical experiment. The Fidel-patria-revolution moniker continued, however. This institutionalization ratified socialism and the rule of the PCC; no challenges were permitted. The Organs of Popular Power were an embodiment of this program. They oversaw state administration, such as schools and industries being transferred to the municipal assemblies. In the early 1980s, one third of the economy was overseen by local Popular Power groups. Multiple candidacies were allowed in secret-ballot elections, with 55% of the National Assembly being elected (the other 45% were appointed by the PCC). Municipal assemblies were the link between government and citizens. Many local meetings were inefficient, but the National Assembly blamed state administration. There was dual centralization and decentralization. Local assemblies at times alienated the people and did little other than espouse dogma. Local delegation embodied much work and little power. The National Assembly had more formal and symbolic purpose. Debates were had between deputies. Proposals could be modified but never rejected, but Castro's voice was the last. The dictatorship of the proletariat could devolve into dictatorship by bureaucracy. National leaders should not participate in local meetings. Conciencia was more important than institutions and popular participation. Resource allocation was one of many topics forbidden from discussion. Humberto Perez, a technocrat uninvolved in the original revolution, was head of the Economic Management and Planning System, allowing some self-financed enterprise and some autonomy. Markets were important despite communist will. More goods with higher prices allowed in peasant markets. Cuba allowed for enterprise to contract labor directly. The SPDE allowed for higher wages for more productive workers. It was overall in conflict with early revolutionary zeal. Despite this, politics and ideology were most important.
The trade unions were supplanted by vanguard workers. In the 1980s, however, 40,000 enterprises had trade unions. Institutionalisation meant the revival of unions as mass organizations. The late 1960s uncovered errors in the functioning of unions, with a petit-bourgeois spirit present in their administration. Still, increasing production was the most important goal. Only 10/57 workers said that defence of worker interests were an important role of unions. 
The early 1970s saw more labor discipline and a linkage of wage to performance alongside greater availability with goods. Shockingly, labor productivity grew. Sugar prices plummeted in 1976 and stayed there, but wage raises equaled or surpassed productivity increases. Unemployment aggravated inflation, and laid off workers got 70% of their salary until they got a new job. In 1984, the economy was once again growing alongside consumption, but these lavish salaries for laid off workers were unsustainable.
Socialism was said to have allowed for good worker-management relations. Workers had to be punctual and take care of their instruments. Both management and unions were lax in upholding safety standards. Between 1974-1978, 85% of workers participated in assemblies to help plan production, albeit with partial information and limited results. Managers were implored to give feedback. Both unions and managers wanted enterprise autonomy. These concessions did not increase discipline, however. Castro said in 1979 that labor laws protected delinquency and not good workers. Management was given the right to sanction or dismiss workers in 1980, something that was fought by unions unsuccessfully. 
Castro stated that women's full equality did not yet exist. No women sat on the Politburo or Secretariat. Women and men did not differ in educational attainment in the 1980s. Economics was majority female as was philosophy. Overall, they made up the majority of university students between 1986-1987. Women outnumbered men in the medical field, which Castro clamped down on, as foreign medical support was a major industry and women had more family responsibilities and more stigma existed against female doctors in many other countries. Women, then, were not allowed to make their own decision. By the mid 1980s, 25% of leadership posts were held by women, against 6% between 1968-1974. 
Women joining the work force was seen as necessary for overcoming inequality, but the SDPE wanted efficiency. Some jobs were proscribed for women, something that was controversial. In 1976, women were barred for 300 jobs that were detrimental for their health, but was truly caused by male underemployment. Women without jobs was seen as a smaller problem then men without jobs. Even then, women participation in the labor force still increased, but new women workers generally were educated. Managers sometimes saw women as unprofitable. Fewer than a quarter of managers were women, and most were junior. Only 8.7% of enterprise directors were female. Women also earned significantly less than men. Family and household obligations mostly fell to women.
The party was seen to be immortal, and the 1970s were dedicated to strengthening it. The Politburo, Secretariat, and Central Committee did not unction in the late 1960s, and were brought to life in the early 1970s. Central Committee membership by military drastically declined. Some new bodies joined orthodox structures in the process of institutionalisation. 1986 marked the first true elite turnover, with 50% of the Central Committee not being incumbents. Cuba worried about the masses due to [[Solidarność]] and other liberalizing forces in communism. Cuban socialism, however, due to Fidel, was unique.
The new constitution was supported and the PCC became a vanguard party. 1975 was a good year for Cuba, with reconciliation between old and new communists and a good economy. [[Salvador Allende]] welcomed Fidel Castro, breaking Cuban isolation, and between 1970-1975 eight countries established recognition. Cuba joined the Non-Aligned Movement, and Cuba supported the [[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] which successfully defeated [[South Africa]] backed forces. Cuba beat back [[Somalia]] in the [[Ogaden Conflict]], boosting Cuban prestige. [[Leonid Brezhnev]] visited Cuba, showing trust in Fidel and Raul and finally restoring good relations. Cuban intervention in Angola was a Cuban idea but was only possible due to the USSR. The [[Vietnam War]] meant the US could not intervene. The costs of the intervention were worth Cuba's new valor and prestige. Castro could rally people to serve in a foreign war but not improve well-being. [[Gerald Ford]] talked with Cuba in a display of some moderation. The US wished to end perpetual antagonism, but Angola blew this dialogue, now being an active threat in the Cold War. US Congress passed the Clark Amendment ending any intervention in Angola, and Africa mostly supported Cuban action, turning Cuba into a larger force than a minor power would expect. Fidel refused to accept humiliating conditions in exchange for reconciliation, but in theory supported detente. [[Jimmy Carter]] sought to improve relations with Cuba as well. Cuba's Ethiopia intervention again ended dialogue. Katanga was expected to also have Cuban involvement. 1980 was a challenging year. 10,000 Cubans went to the [[Peru|Peruvian]] embassy and 125,000 left in the Mariel boatlift. 100,000 Cuban American visited the island to visit their families, which also helped spur exodus. Exiles supplied boats so that family could go to the US. Cuba's backing of the [[Soviet-Afghan War]] dulled its luster, and relations with [[Venezuela]], [[Peru]], and [[Colombia]] deteriorated. [[Ronald Reagan]] was more hostile to Cuba, alongside the [[Sandinista Revolution]] and [[American Invasion of Granada]], Cuba was seen as the source of the region's trouble. Dialogue was still open, however, with an immigration agreement being signed in 1983. The US's broadcasts of Radio Marti, like Radio Free Europe (pro democracy broadcast in communist lands), started in 1985, ending much of goodwill at the behest of the Cuban exile community. Washington and Havana successfully brokered a deal to end the war in Angola and South Africa and recognize [[Namibia|Namibian]] independence. The US saw Havana as a major world player. Cuba also lost a lot in Angola, with the proportion of soldiers sent every year being greater than America's at the peak of Vietnam. By 1988-1989, the taste of victory faded. The early 1980s saw some liberalization, with peasant markets, arts and crafts, self-employment, and a housing market all being legalized. The economy faced deteriorating international headwinds, with foreign exchange declining and trade deficits growing. Soviet aid also decreased. Castro stated that the SDPE encouraged capitalism and undermined socialism. [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] underwent a different type of communist renewal, one of opening to the capitalist west.

## Rectification and Reconstitution, 1986-1998
Castro's rectification and Gorbachev's reforms of [[Glasnost]] and [[Perestroika]] came about in the same time, but were starkly different. Rectification was a movement towards the radical experiment rather than an opening of markets and proto-democracy. Cuba under Castro would not see economic decentralization. The downfall of the USSR meant the downfall of Cuba's economic insurance. Cubans in Miami thought that Havana would be next to fall. Fidel-patria-revolution was not the slogan of the people.
During the mid 1980s, Cuba's failure to grow was reckoned with, and alongside it austerity and a decrease in living standards followed. Socialism, however, was entrenched in nationalism, unlike the Eastern Bloc. Cuba now had to stand on its own economic performance, but the conciencia was dictated by socialist reality. Most Cubans were born after 1959 or were too young to remember the revolution.
In 1986, the government saw the waste in the investment process, with budgets and price inflation rampant. Workers were given higher wages than deserved and discipline was low. The SDPE failed to deliver results. Volunteer work practically disappeared and in its place nepotism thrived. Government officials did not listen to public opinion. Wage funds were controlled locally, thus salaries were set partially by those being paid, driven by an influx of goods in stores. Austerity was introduced in December 1986, with prices rising for many government goods. At the same time, the Cuban public didn't even work during the dawn of revolution, and thus appeals to devote themselves to this new revolution were mostly ignored. Average salary decreased in the most efficient sectors. Unions protected workers against management, and were frequently successful due to better support. 3/5 cases were again ruled for workers, a full-circle from the 1940s. Cuba looked towards [[Japan]] with more productivity and less free time.
Between 1986-1989, there was a focus on the PCC, saying the man, rather than profit, should be the center. Microbrigades building apartments grew after SDPE decline. More than 400,000 people volunteered to meet these and similar tasks, and, after 1990, thousands of urbanites were sent to do agriculture. Castro continued to stress PCC preeminence despite its failures. Rectification, like revolution, was populist. The poorest had raised salaries and examples were made of good workers, a similar feel to the anti-bureaucracy campaign of the 1960s. Cuban socialism did not result in new democracy. Power replaced money as the primary motive. Ochoa, a heroic Cuban general, was accused of drug trafficking alongside other officers. These 1989 arrests may have had political undercurrent. High-ranking officials lived above the means of the average citizen, faces of socialism were part of an entrenched elite. 
Raul Castro's llamamiento (convocation) extolled the revolution. It solidified the PCC being the party of revolution, but also encouraged tolerance of religious Cubans among others.
Rectification criticized the CTC for often being against national interests, and should instead foster discipline and productivity. Conciencia was not aided by the radical experiment or institutionalization, rectification would be the same. FMC members in the 1960s were mostly housewives, now almost all were professionals or retirees and had less sway with younger women. The FMC had its existence questioned in 1990 for failing to attract the new generation and the PCC criticized it. 
Granma published a note which defined the boundaries of debate, but citizens were more able to criticize the government than ever before since institutionalisation. The Fourth Party Congress was met in this time of intense struggle and the disintegration of the USSR. It sought to define Cuban socialism as unique. During all of Fidel's reign, Cuba never had a self-sufficient economy. People Power and the National Assembly would be directly elected, alongside the reopening of some self-employment. More Central Committee members worked in the provinces and were slightly younger at this time.
Cuba turned its attention to agricultural production through state farms and volunteer work. A cutting of bureaucracy and electricity consumption would help save money. They continued this plan in 1991 despite early failures, and only adopted some market reform in 1993, including making the [[United States Dollar]] legal tender. Unlike the [[Chinese Economy]] and [[Vietnam]], Cuba never planned further market reopening. The special period saw many buy in unofficial agricultural markets, with half of the population having dollars. [[Deng Xiaoping]] said that "to get rich is glorious," something not in Castro's vernacular. Cuban decentralization was entirely administrative, not market. Taking this further may have led Cuba down the Chinese model. Instead, foreign direct investment remained low.
Under Fidel, elites remained in lockstep. Even in the 1990s, rough conditions did not sway loyalty away from the Comandante. Personnel changes were routine, and Raul Castro thought that cadres should only hold the same post for five years. 1992 saw people's right to armed struggle added to the constitution. Cuba had a siege mentality, with the whole of politics being seen in military terms. The worst was over during 1995-1997, while the PCC continued denying political crisis. Castro was still fully in charge; any change from this order was unthinkable. The PCC grew more rapidly in this time as well. A decrease in the size of the Central Committee mainly targeted the ordinary citizens elected.
Popular Power Assemblies were more able to call out problems than the National Assembly, and many wanted to reform the ageing and oft forgotten institution. They were the parallel to Soviet local elections. The only national elections were negative: not voting. Fidel vigorously opposed multiple parties, thinking it would fracture the already-gained majority. Fidel was angry that people would speak in the National Assembly before he could explain. More than one-third of ballots in the next election were blank. Government officials hoped to get this one-third into the fold, and did so by educating citizens on voting rules. In the next election, 18% of voters did not vote for every candidate, demonized "selective voting."
The military led 1970 institutionalisation, 1980 rectification, and economic reform in 1990. Civic soldiers, like always, were the center of consciousness. The military was strong and stable, the antithesis of the PCC. They sought to assuage the populace of fears of collapse after the USSR fell. The military was tapped to make economic reforms that would have been heresy before. In budget and Central Committee seats, the FAR (military) seemed in decline, but Cuban political culture was entwined with military values. In 1997, FAR took over the sugar ministry, a sign of the people's belief in their power.
Revolution left no quarter for opponents. Unity was national sovereignty, national interest was individual interest. Thus, politics needed to support Cuban diversity. It needed to acknowledge everyday reality while maintaining revolutionary spirit. Cuban politics could not accommodate cycles of support and opposition. Student organizations mobilized the young, peasant provided food, workers gave legitimacy. The FMC lost its political niche with the decline of its broad support of women, and women bore the brunt of economic collapse. Feminism was not mainstream, and anything not mainstream was rarely discussed until the special period post 1991. Familial structure and machismo began to be discussed, but prostitution was rarely mentioned. Parlamentos stated that problems like theft and lack of discipline were aggravated by the crisis of the special period. Mass demonstrations were less common and raft emigration was more. The coast guard stopped trying to stop those wishing to leave and those who left were not repudiated. Public opinion in contemporary Cuba was hard to gauge and still is. In Santiago at the time, 28% of young people thought about leaving and most wanted reform. University students were not taught Cuban socialist history but remembered renting toys. A Gallup poll said that only 21% of respondents described themselves as communist or socialist, while 48% considered themselves revolutionaries. 53% wished to start their own business. 88% were "very proud" to be Cuban. Cuban leaders still did not face an organized opposition, but their legitimacy was tarnished.

## Mobilizational Politics Redux and Raul Castro's Cuba
Cuba unexpectedly maintained its government at the turn of the millennium. The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, which strengthened the embargo, did not crash the country, and Cuba endeared itself to European and Latin American US allies. [[Canada]] among others strengthened ties, but efforts to change the course of the country were in vein. [[Hugo Chávez]] was an extraordinarily similar leader to Fidel and thus a true ally. When Fidel became ill in 2006, Raul shelved Fidel's politics.
The [[Fall of the Berlin Wall]] gave hope to some exiles that something similar would happen in Cuba. US policy centered around regime change for the first time since the 1960s. The regime, meanwhile, called US interventions in Cuban affairs as an attempt of a new [[Platt Amendment]].
Clinton assumed that Cuba would either fall with the Soviets or that increased contact with the outside could open the country. [[Bill Clinton]] wished for better relations tacitly. The US's Cuban Adjustment Act gave all Cubans the right to permanent residency, which motivated exiles. Castro let a huge group pass to the US, and the US intercepted over 32000 citizens, but all eventually passed to the mainland. Then, only those seeking asylum were welcomed. Some concession were made by both sides, making hardliners in both countries angry. Many moderates in the US sought the end of the [[American Embargo on Cuba]]. The shooting of US planes in international waters refroze relations. In 1999, travel was reopened slightly, further thawing.
[[George W. Bush]] hardened policy again, albeit slowly. Carter visited the country. [[Colin Powell]] called for the end of the Castro dictatorship and prosecuting former officials. At the same time, some Cuban Americans began to go against hardline talks, with only 57.5% supporting the embargo in 2007. 67% wanted unrestricted travel. [[Barack Obama]] ran on a platform for unlimited travel to Cuba, and further opened up relations. Most Cuban exiles voted for [[John McCain]] while most second generation Cubans voted for Obama. In 2011, academic travel among other travel was open and direct flights begun. The US supports democracy in Vietnam and China through USAID, but only in Cuba is regime change the single goal.
The international community generally disavowed both the embargo and the Cuban government. Washington stated that the Cuban government was as bad as [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet's]]. [[Pope John Paul II]] opposed the embargo, seen as a moral victory by Cuban leaders. He was as against unfettered capitalism as he was against communism, instead espousing humanist beliefs. The Mexican president among others met with dissidents, and stated that only by guaranteeing freedom could sovereignty be maintained.
Beginning in the 1970s, Cuban foreign policy was outward looking, the best antidote to embargo. [[Lula da Silva]] visited Havana in 2008 and Canada continued respecting Cuba. China emerged as Cuba's second largest trading partner after [[Venezuela]] in the 2000s; this was due to economics, not politics. Russo-Cuban relations also improved, but Cuba refused ever stationing nuclear arms there. [[Iran]] and Cuba also cooperated. Venezuela was possibly the closest ally, alongside [[Bolivia]] and [[Nicaragua]]. 
The Miami mafia was used as an epithet for the Cuban exiles. Revolutionary vigilance was reborn, with loyalty oaths in factories. Fidel rejected market reforms and thus did not call PCC congresses in 2002 or 2003. 2002 saw Castro make millions sign a petition to safeguard the revolution and socialism in the constitution. Fidel was living in a different world than Cubans. This was his last major action before falling ill in 2006. Fidel visited China in 2003 and admired the transformation, but reused to undergo great changes. Instead, ideas were Cuba's nuclear weapon. Many leftists were dismayed by Cuban treatment of peaceful dissidents. The Vatican harshly spoke against Castro. The [[European Union]] begun ineffective diplomatic sanctions. By 2005 Cuba had contact in [[Spain]] and 8 other EU countries. Raul Castro gained power amidst Fidel's illness, but proclaimed the PCC as his true successor. Fidel's control of Cuba seemed impossible. Even in the 1970's [[Mao Zedong]] was restrained. Cubans never went against Castro.
Raul better understood ordinary Cubans and their needs. He built institutions and wanted normalcy. Chavez, at the UN, called George W. Bush the devil and said he could smell the sulphur at the podium. He lost a seat on the Security Council.
Since 2006, Raul showed that decision making should flow through institutions. A Chinese style transformation was not in the cards, but mild steps away from Fidel were. Raul appointed Machado, an old and loyal character, as vice president. Raul wished to model himself more like [[Deng Xiaoping]], a figure that transformed a country while maintaining party control. Raul still did not support civil liberties, treating protestors as harshly as Fidel. He declared the end to the government's provisional status in 2008 and formed a Politburo commission, an end to one man rule. He wished for wages to match productivity and an end to some free services. State paternalism was no longer supported. Many peaceful opponents agitated for change. The international community implored Havana to spare the lives of protestors. Raul freed some prisoners, although many were exiled. To change the EU's mind, human rights reform was necessary. Currently, dangerousness, a state of mind threatening national security, was a crime, for instance. Vietnam already signed an agreement of economic cooperation with the EU, a possible next step.
Raul, unlike Fidel, accepted decentralization and market incentives. The state paid debts to cooperatives and peasants, and also sold tools in Cuban convertible pesos, purchasable from USD or the [[Euro]]. Some consumer goods were allowed to be imported, and Cubans could enter foreign-only areas. Wage ceiling were abolished, and productivity should be the sole barometer. Since these reforms were mostly affecting CUCs, most could not afford to take advantage of these limited reforms. Still, the psychology of the country changed, Cubans could finally be consumers. The government leased some idle lands, but ownership was still out of the question. In 2011, the plan was for 500,000 workers in the state sector were laid off. 400,000 would be self-employed. Salaries for laid off workers would only be paid for a year. Some services were cut to save the backbone of socialism. Still, excessive taxes and personal loans were uncharted territory for Cuba. Those who earned their living in the black market were understandable afraid to suddenly come out in the light, especially due to Fidel's erratic changes in economic programs. Few self-employment opportunities existed. Reforms must come with a new social contract. This 2011 PCC Congress marked the 50th anniversary of the Bay of Pigs, with Fidel Castro attending as a party member, not leader. It, however, was not entirely symbolic. Top leadership could only serve two consecutive terms, the Central Committee went from 150 to 115 members with 42% being women. Blacks and mulatto representation increased, albeit not to their share of the population. Institutions now met regularly, with ministers frequently inviting observers to meetings. The party previously went 14 years without holding a congress. Economic updates were institutionally backed. Abrupt, autocratic changes were meant to be phased out. This congress indicted the past 50 years of history, the same problems in 1960 faced Cuba in 2010. This legacy toward a fidelista revolutionary zeal took them away from the Sino-Vietnamese model. Doublespeak still was the heart of Cuban politics.
