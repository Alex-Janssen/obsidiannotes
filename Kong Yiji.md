# Kong Yiji
## Reading Notes
Kong Yiji was a self-important failure of a scholar, who peppered his speech with old vocabulary and wore long robes. He refused to admit that stealing books was stealing. He failed the examination and was a drunk. He abhored debts and was generous, still seeing himself as upper class. Kong Yiji was attacked for stealing and presumably died, but not before paying off his debt.
Criticism of [[Confucianism]] and its emphasis in traditional culture during the [[Qing Dynasty]], especially the examination system.
