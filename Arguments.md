# Arguments
## Deductive Reasoning
Deductive arguments rely on premises necesitating the conclusion to be true, similar to implies in discrete math.  For instance, if all men are mortal and Plato is a man, then Plato is mortal.  This reasoning relies on fundamental principles in order to come to a conclusion.
## Inductive Reasoning
Inductive reasoning is statistical in nature.  It relies on previous observations holding, for instance the sun rising in the East.  We know this will happen, in lay terms, because we have observed it always happening, but this is not grounded in fundamental principles (ignore the field of physics).  This leaves doubt; the premises do not lend full support to the conclusion, but increase probability.  While often not seen as scientific, inductive arguments are often valid.
## Abductive Reasoning
Abduction, meanwhile, is the formation of a conclusion which can fit premises, rather than premises supporting a conclusion.  This is very common in science, and law is a good example (determining guilt/innocence because it fits the narrative told by the facts).  This reasoning, like inductive reasoning and unlike deductive, does not preserve the truth, but it proposes a theory.  Inductive reasoning generalizes past phenomena, wheras abductive reasoning explains a particular past event.
## Analogical Reasoning
Analogy is the connection of two like things in order to propose shared traits.  Errors and debate in analogical reasoning often come from the linking of two concepts as to be close enough to share traits or to support a shared conclusion.
## Fallacies
Beyond these types of often sound reasoning, there are arguments born from fallacious reasoning.  These include but are not limited to the "Slippery Slope", where one change is taken to an extreme, "No true Scotsman," where a definition is taken to be so restrictive as to render the concept meaningless, "Argument from Authority" where the speaker is seen to have better views due to personal qualities and not reasoning, Equivication where a term is defined in multiple ways when conveninet, "Begging the Question" which is supposing a premise that needs support, and "Ad Hominem" where a speaker is attacked for personal qualities instead of the idea.
