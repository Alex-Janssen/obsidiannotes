# Soviet Influence on Cuban Culture

## The Cuban Soviet Relationship
1917 saw the beginning of [[Russia|Russian]] interest in [[Cuba]]. The destruction of the [[Russian Revolution]] and [[First World War]] led to a possibility of a reconstruction of Russian culture under a Communist lens. The [[Comintern]] simultaneously was anti-imperialist while supporting the Eastern Bloc's authoritarianism, placing the USSR as the center of the Communist world. Comintern style socialism had a place in Cuban discourse, but a distinctly Cuban strain developed during the first and second republics. Between 1924-29, the Cuban socialist ideology complemented Marxism by implementing ideas from [[José Martí]] and [[Simón Bolivar]] along with local thinkers who occasionally opposed other socialisms. Cultural exchange began in earnest in 1943, with 1945 seeing the idea that Moscow and Havana were the poles of the old and new world. Cultural tools meant that Moscow exerted soft power over Havana. 
The marriage between the USSR and Cuba was one of convenience. The USSR needed supply, and Cuba protection. In 1960, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] vastly increased the amount of sugar purchased, in line with deals made with other developing countries. By 1960, Soviet aid began to snowball, with the USSR replacing American consumption after the sugar quota. Khrushchev also saw Cuba as a key military location to threaten the USA. Cuba was made the figurehead of Latin American revolution. 1961 saw the declaration of the Cuban government as officially [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]]. On April 16, 1961, the [[Cuban Revolution]] was first declared Communist, a day before the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]]. The youthfulness of the Cuban population was a useful motivator for a Soviet populace which was 50% young: Cuba was a symbol of international revolution.
