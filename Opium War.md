# Opium War

## First Opium War
The First Opium War was a minor war between the [[Qing Dynasty]] and [[British Empire]] in 1839-1842. 
The Qing population nearly doubled from 1749-1811. Productivity increased, but not enough to offset the decrease in quality of life. British demanded free trade, and silver flowed into China without British gooods to offset. Opium was produced in the [[British Raj]], and was a counterbalance, leading to mass smuggling and Chinese addiction. Some say to prohibit opium, other to legalize and tax it. Lin Zexu decides to ban it, confiscating and destroying British opium in [[Guangzhou]] and embargoing foreign traders. This motivates the British decision to declare war.
Qing was in a period of peace while Europe was in constant war in the wake of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and European industrailization fueled European dominance. 
The First Opium War saw an outnumbered British military soundly defeat the Qing.
Ends in Treaty of [[Nanjing]], leading to opening of ports, tariffs, cessation of [[Hong Kong]], equal treatment between officials, among other trends. This is an example of an Unequal Treaty. Some see this as the beginning of China's modernization, but others see this as minor with the 1850s-60s which is a more major movement.
