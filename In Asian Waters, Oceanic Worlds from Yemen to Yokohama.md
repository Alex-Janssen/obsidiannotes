# In Asian Waters, Oceanic Worlds from Yemen to Yokohama

## South from Nagasaki, West from Hormuz
(Shouldn't it be East from Hormuz???)
[[Nagasaki]] was the epicenter of [[Western Trade with Japan]], with religion and guns spreading from there. Both [[Oman]] and Japan have links by virtue of being part of the Maratime Asiatic world. The book is a transnational history of Asian waters as a globalizing force. External power and internal resistence is a major theme, with trade and religion spread on ships. The sea is a fertile area for transational research, exposing many pertinet issues in contempory history. Pacific History is emerging as a field in its own right. Maritime Southeast Asia has seen a wealth of maritime study, with [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and [[The Philippines]] inextricably linked with the ocean. The [[Indian Ocean]] has been a more active battleground for scholarship. Southeast Asia is the heart of the book, and arguably the trade, with various catagories of actors studied in relation to their impacts on the system.

## Passage of Amulets
(Ye Dharma!!!!!!!!!!!!)
Spices and marine products were some of the few goods worthy to be transported in these marine trade routes, alongside religious objects. [[Buddhism]] travelled from [[India]] and South Asia all across Asia. Economies emerged to support seafaring journeys around ports. India and [[China]] were centers for this. Chinese trade was more impactful than religious exports. The [[Bay of Bengal]] was a focal point of Buddhism and [[Hinduism]] moving East to Southeast Asia. Indian coasts were littered with [[Temples in Hinduism|Hindu Temples]]. Southern [[Siam]], [[Sukhotai]], [[Bagan]], and the [[Khmer Empire]] form part of SEA's rich history of spirituality and contact with Hinduism and Buddhism (see [[Angkor Wat]]). [[Ayutthaya]] was much more sea-facing than [[Sukhotai]], leading to frequent contact with India and [[Sri Lanka]], becoming a cosmopolitan Buddhist kingdom, with a [[Greece|Greek]] foreign minister living in the city. 
Amulets are integral to Thai culture and their introduction coincides with Buddhism's influence in Thailand. The [[Chola Empire]], alongside trade, introduced Hindu tradition to SEA, alongside Buddhism with which Hinduism intermixed. Indic symbols change meaning when adapted, i.e. in Angkor or [[Champa]]. The [[Deccan]] (or [[Sri Lanka]]) may have produced icons of [[Avalokiteshvara]] and other Bodhisatvas for much of Thailand. Southern Thailland linked the Andaman with the north. Coastal plains became the foodbasket as well as the market. 
Amulets among other goods are useful objects of study, as, uniquely (unlike textiles), they preserve remarkably well. By the end of the first millenium the Indian Ocean was well-trafficked and linked Maritime Asia. Indic religion and models of governance were spread too. 


## Commentary
Is the study of the ocean meaningful? This is similar to [[Silk Road]] history, the road is a subject, not an actor. The ocean enables more connectivity, but this still doesn't center the ocean beyond it as a trade route. Does it do anything land transit doesn't?
