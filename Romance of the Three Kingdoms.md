# Romance of the Three Kingdoms
## General Summary
Romance of the Three Kingdoms is centered around the ambition and political intrigue of the successors to the Han Empire.  Fundamentally rooted in [[Confucianism|Confucian]] concpets of governance, the book starts with the historical [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]], with their instigators seen as magicians.  The generals who fight this rebellion include Liu Bei and Cao Cao, who, along with Sun Quan, form the three major characters of the novel.  Dong Zhuo is seen as an extraordinarily corrupt minister who tries to uproot the emperor, but Wang Yun uses a female servent of his, Cicada, to seduce Liu Bei and cause conflict between Dong Zhuo and him.  In the end, Dong Zhuo is falsely told of the emperor's abdication, and is killed there.  However, Dong Zhuo loyalist rebels maintain a foothold, and Chang'an is threatened.  In the end, rebels approach the emperor and kill Wang Yun.
Cao Cao has gained a major upper hand, threatening Sun Quan and Liu Bei and hoping to marry two wives of the allied generals.  In the end, after much negotiation, they seek to use water, Cao Cao's weakness, to their advantage.  In particular, Zhuge Liang, a Liu Bei ally, aids Sun Quan.  Zhou Yu believes that Zhuge Liang has too much knowledge, and sends him on various suicidal tasks in order to kill him discretely.  However, Zhuge Liang is aware of this.  Liu Bei visits Sun Quan, and Zhou Yu attempts to kill him as well, but, due to Liu Bei's brother, a fearsome warrior, being present, the assassination is not carried out.  Guan Yu notices this attempt and cautions Liu.  Zhou Yu let a friend of his, serving Cao Cao, steal a fake letter saying that two capable commanders were traitors, which, in fact, led to Cao Cao killing innocent, capable men.  Zhuge Liang aids another attack, and Zhou Yu beats a man under the pretense of treason, but the true reason is to fake a defection in order to feed Cao Cao incorrect information.  Pan Tong also goes to Cao Cao in order for him to link his ships with iron, which will let fire spread.  Zhou Yu calls for the construction of an Daoist alter in order to conjure an eastern wind, which Kong Ming successfully does.  A succesful assault almost kills Cao Cao and reduces his fleet to ash.  Cao Cao escapes, and Guan Yu refuses to capture him or his soldiers, and Guan Yu turns himself in to receive the death penalty.

## Introduction
The book is fundamentally about human ambition, with a minor theme about the invevitability of change.
Ideas of literature are different between China and the West, this book is not taken extraordinarily seriously while some of the Chinese conception of literature is not respected in the West.
Due to dramatizations on stage, even the illiterate enjoy Chinese literature like Romance of the _Three Kingdoms_.
Reactions against Confucian society are also at the heart of the novel.
The novels were partly popular as a counternarritive to the ideals of the Chinese state.
The characters are real people, but the vast majority of events in the novel are fictional.
When this book was written, China was under foreign rule and there was a great appitite for books about their own history.
The novel covers the collapse of the later Han to the rise of the [[Qin Dynasty]].
The novel was compiled from various stories into a cohesive whole.
Luo Guanzhong was likely the author of this and a few other novels.
Luo compares the influence of the [[Mandate of Heaven]] with the influence of ambition.
The Han heir is treated with sympathy.  Legitimacy was needed when the novel was written under foreign occupation.
The book was adapted for a storyteller.

Cao Cao is introduced as a fellow rebel-fighter, although he gains a lot of control behind the dynasty.
Yuan Te and his brothers meet Liu Chi, who almost defeated the rebels but was superceded by Dong Zhuo because he did not bribe a eunich.

##### Analysis
What is long united must divide, what is long divided must unite, very Daoist idea of a constant cycle of change.
Han is mentioned as a product of this cycle.  Almost reminds me of ashes to ashes.
Somewhat like [[Water Margin]], officials (eunichs) are shown to be the downfall, but criticism of early [[Han Dynasty]] emperors is more direct.
Changing of genders is seen as a sign of evil.  Eunichs seen as an evil feminine influence on the state.
"You are able enough to rule the world, but wicked enough to destroy it" about Cao Cao, why does he rejoice in this?

##### Questions
Does this book implicitly condone rebellion?
Is the Yellow Turban Revolt treated sympathetically?  It is popular, but undermines the stability of the Han Dynasty.
Why does every chapter in this book end in a cliffhanger as well?

##### Analysis
Dong Zhuo is the anti-Liu Bei, a scheming anti-emperor.
Dong Zhuo justifies deposing the emperor partially off of not mourning, held to very strict [[Confucianism|Confucian]] morals.
"To kill deliberately is wrong" vs "I would rather betray the whole world than have the whole world betray me," selflessness vs ambition in Chen Kung and Cao Cao.

##### Questions
How is Dong Zhuo viewed in the novel?  The emperor is weak, but it seems that the overthrow of empire is seen as a step too far.
Why is so much poetry present in this novel?  Water Margin had none.

Lu Bu attempts to find Cicada, but is accused of trying to seduce Dong Zhuo's concubine.

##### Analysis
Dong Zhuo seems to be viewed in terms of arrogance.
I assume cicada is seen as self sacrificial and benevolent, putting country over oneself.

##### Questions
What is the line between cruelty and just war?
Why is it seen as justifiable for a woman to be used as a political tool?  Her life and chastity?
How does Lu Bu's love reconcile with the Confucian virtue of resisting romantic relationships?

Dong Zhuo dies largely due to the arrogance brought on by the sycophant Li Su.

##### Questions
How deep does loyalty run, that even after having a halberd thrown at Lu he runs and contemplates revenge instead of directly exacting it?

### 43
##### Plot
Zhuge Liang refuses to lie to Sun Quan about the size of Caocao's army.
Cao Cao wants Sun Quan to join him in attacking Liu Bei, promising a share of the spoils.

Cao Cao's men are tired and far from home, and are weak on water.

##### Analysis
Flattery seems to be a major political tool, stroking egos to get what you want.  Liu Cong surrendered to Cao Cao on them, much like what Sun Quan was given.
Zhuge Liang's criticism of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] learning, saying that learning texts is not nearly as relevant as enacting policy, is very interesting.

##### Questions
How loyal is Cao Cao?  Is the letter's promise real?
What does Zhuge Liang mean by "serve?"  Serve Cao Cao?

### 44
##### Plot
Sun Quan's dying mother asked him to consult Zhou Yu's advice on foreign affairs.
Zhou Yu also sought to submit to Cao Cao.  The generals did not wish to surrender, however.
Zhou Yu pushes for surrender, to Lu Su's chagrin.
Zhuge Liang also apparently sees surrendering as reasonable.
Zhuge Liang advises two people to be sent across the river who would apparently disrupt Cao Cao's entire scheme.
Cao Cao wishes for two women, which, Zhuge believes, would interrupt the war.
Zhou Yu is insulted, because one of the women is his wife and the other is the widow of the former king.
Sun Quan, after hearing Zhou Yu's advice, decides against surrender, even though he is still afraid at the disparity of the army sizes.

Zhuge Liang's brother meets him, crying over the fact that they serve different sides of the war.
Zhou Yu attempts to gain Zhuge Liang's loyalty.

##### Analysis
Interesting dichotomy between civil and military opinions, with the former seen as weak and the latter as brave.
Again, women are seen as the undoing of powerful men.
As discussed in ASIA 335, the elements are used as crucial parts of the story, Cao Cao is seen to be weak in water.
An interesting commentary on how war splits families apart with Zhuge Liang; war is often shown to be brutal, not so much in [[Water Margin]].

##### Questions
Is there a general distate for bureaucracy in the book?  With the rant against scholars and now the lilly-livered bureaucrats?
Why is the legitimacy of Cao Cao based off of the legitimate emperor being his puppet?  Is it that taboo to rebel against monarchy?

### 45
##### Plot

Zhou Yu gives Zhuge Liang a trap assignment to cut off supplies, which Zhuge is obliged to accept but realizes is a trap.

Zhou Yu, against Lu Su's caution, kills Cao Cao's messanger to send a message.
Zhou Yu bested Cao Cao at a river battle.  Zhou Yu also spies on their camp, enraging Cao.
Zhou Yu's friend who served Cao Cao stole a letter which revealed some supposed Cao Cao allies as planning an ambush.
These two commanders were put to death, but the letter was actually a trick, and Cao Cao killed capable commanders for no reason.

##### Analysis
Zhuge Liang maintains fierce loyalty but is very capable; these two qualities seem inextricably linked.
Zhou Yu seems to be rash, and Lu Su cautious.  Are they almost a [[Daoism|Daoist]] Yin-Yang?

##### Questions
Why are numbers so frequently mentioned?  While Cao Cao has a hundred legions and talented leaders, the plot revolves around two women being his undoing.
Why is Liu Bei noted as being quite naive?  Is this a symptom of being virtuous?

### 46
##### Plot
Zhuge Liang was aware of the trick that Zhou Yu played on Cao.
Zhou Yu again calls for Zhuge's assassination to Lu Su, wanting to kill him in a discrete way.
Zhuge Liang is asked for an inordinate quantity of arrows in ten days, which he promises in three.

Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang are aware that they are spies, and want to feed false information.
Huang Gai offers desertion, allowing to be physically injured in order to be more believable.  He then asks for surrender, making Zhou Yu contemplate execution.
The beating is a ruse, the spies will have seen it and it makes desertion more believable.

##### Analysis
Zhou Yu has to be tactful in assassination.  There are more noble ways of killling than others, where Cao Cao's army is referred to as a barbarian horde Liu Bei's is seen as scrutable.
There is a fascinating political conflict within Sun Quan's camp, with Lu Su disobaying Zhou Yu.
Fire is the plan concocted by the group, using elements again as a key element of warfare.

##### Questions
What is the purpose behind Zhuge's oneupsmanship?  He is constantly outpreforming other generals, and is aware of things he should not be.
Zhuge Liang is seen to be quasi magical, like the Yellow Turban leaders.  How does he know the workings of heaven so accurately?  How can he predict and change the weather?
Why does Huang Gai consent to being mutilated just to help the war effort?

### 47
##### Plot
A letter is sent to Cao Cao asking for defection on Huang Gai's behalf.
Cao Cao suspects this is a trick, and the messenger laughs while being punished.
The messenger laughs at Cao Cao, saying he is too ignorant in being skeptical, which angers him.  He turns, and accepts the messenger and Huang Gai.
The spies reveal themselves to Huang Gai and the messenger, as they think they will desert.
Pang Tong advises the generals to use fire against Cao Cao.
Zhou Yu pretends to be angry at his friend for misleading him.
The friend (Jiang Gan) is exiled to a hut, where he meets Pang Tong who is upset at Zhou Yu for not allowing others to shine.
Pang Tong goes to Cao Cao to ask for desertion.
Pang Tong suggests a strategy of linking boats together, which, in fact, would let the allies' fire strategy work.
A Daoist stranger knew of Pang Tong's deceit.

##### Analysis
Human psychology is very interstingly disected in the book, how Cao Cao is shown to get angry when presented with his ignorance.

##### Questions
Why does Cao Cao so readily change his mind from putting to death to instating the messenger as a key ally?  Are there no checks and balances?
Why does the messenger refuse gold and silks from Cao Cao?  Honor?  To gain trust?
Why do so many people know of the strategies?  How does intrigue pass?

### 48
##### Plot
The stranger is Pang Tong's friend, who threatens to unveil the scheme unless he is guaranteed safety, which is given.
The friend then misleads Cao Cao into believing there was another attack, and takes some men to guard against this fictional army.
Cao Cao lets it be known that one of his major goals is marrying the two women mentioned.
Liu Fu, a longtime advisor, says that Cao Cao's words are ill omened.  Cao Cao immediately kills him.
Cheng Yu warns Cao Cao about fire, as the iron chains were only meant to make the Northerners not seasick.
Cao Cao is not worried about the fire due to the winds, as Southeast winds do not appear.
Zhou Yu loses a minor skirmish to Cao Cao.

##### Analysis
Cao Cao is definitely known at this point for killing capable ministers.  Zhou Yu wanted to do the same.  I think there is a message of the capable meritocracy being undone by larger personalities.

##### Questions
How does Cao Cao trust so many people?  Are all generals this impressionable?

### 49
##### Plot
Zhou Yu suddenly gets ill.
Zhou Yu's "treatment" is an east wind to use against Cao Cao.
Kong Ming suggests using magic to conjure an eastern wind.
Fire boats are prepared and the spies are distracted while a Daoist alter is constructed to change the wind.
Eventually a wind from the southeast does appear.
Zhou Yu takes this as a sign to kill Kong Ming, as he has too much power.
Kong Ming is aware of this plot, and threatens an assasin.
Zhou Yu waits for victory against Cao Cao to turn his attention back to Kong Ming.
Guan Yu has some loyalty to Cao Cao, and so his part of the plot is up to question.
Another spy admits to Zhou Yu that the two other spies are also under order of Cao Cao.
Cao Cao's boats are lit on fire
Huang Gai almost kills Cao Cao, but is shot and wounded before he could.

##### Analysis
Magic is seen through constructing a Daoist alter, and so religion/spirits and magic are intertwined.

##### Questions
How real is magic?  Did the authors believe in the supernatural, and did they believe this was an accurate account of events?
Daoism seems to be at the heart of a lot of magic, with [[Water Margin]] having the shapeshifting Daoist master and now the alter changing the winds.

### 50
##### Plot
Huang Gai escapes from drowning due to affinity with water.
Cao Cao escapes through the forest, and is stopped by Lu Meng, who supposedly wishes to save him.
They combine forces and Cao Cao is better protected.
Cao Cao laughs that an ambush wasn't planned on the route.
Cao Cao believes the smoke is a ruse, and so goes toward smoke.
Guan Yu meets Cao Cao, and refuses to treat him with prior respect, but eventually lets him go.
Guan Yu asks for death, and admits he took no prisoners.

##### Analysis
Cao Cao again escapes by the skin of his teeth: death for these generals seems to be unlikely.

##### Questions
How fluid is loyalty?  Guan Yu, for instance, is suspicious due to his former ties to Cao Cao.
Is Guan Yu's failure to kill Cao Cao seen as loyal?  Filial?  Traitorous?
