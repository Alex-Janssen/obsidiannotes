# The Middle East and North Africa's Resilient Monarchs

## Takeaway
Compared to republics, monarchies were less susceptible to political violence during the [[Arab Spring]] and have been better at preserving rule of law and spurring economic growth in MENA.

## Introduction
The [[Arab Spring]] saw the longstanding leaders of [[Hosni Mubarak]] of [[Egypt]], [[Ben Ali]] of [[Tunisia]], and [[Muammar Gaddafi]] of [[Libya]] fall and the [[Syrian Civil War]] rage on in a revolutionary fervor spurred on by [[Social Media]].  3/11 non-monarchies changed regime, with monarchies having more muted movements focused on incremental reform rather than overthrow. According to the Banks' Conflict Index, monarchies have seen revolution in 7.6% of years, compared to 26.2% in republics. A mix of formal and informal norms and strategic use of constitutions has enabled monarchs to retain a stable political culture where republics failed. Non-monarchs have coerced opponents using fear and force, creating multiple security apparatuses and weaker limits on power. Monarchies in MENA are less corrupt, more dynamic, and more leaders survive in office, a trend that hold accounting for oil revenues among other effects.

## The Political Economy of Nondemocratic Rule
A commonly held view is that dictatorship stability is tied to a loyalty of a small elite clique, which becomes less loyal as the size increases, thus incentivizing "buying off" key supporters. Dictators need to crush opposition groups to build a new base of support, often supported by a hegemonic political party which uses the legislature as an ally. Others see commitment to institutions which act as a limit of power as bolstering trust and thus approval of rule (i.e. semi-independent courts). Dynastic monarchies, like those in modern MENA, have a huge incentive for regime stability among the elite clique: there are methods for relatives of the leader to compete for power under this system. The [[Shah of Iran]] was non-dynastic, and was overthrown as relatives had no path to success: Arab monarchies thus benefit the entire ruling family as long as the norm itself is not questioned.
Where democracies have law to delimit the power of rulers, the status of regime insider and outsider, and the rewards they are entitled to, non-democracies have political culture. Political culture is disseminated through clear inclusion into political circles, norms and institutions giving rents to these insiders, and accountability to the leader in case they do not follow through. In MENA monarchies, these norms are regular and predictable, allowing for elite trust and buy-in to future plans. Elites gather in assemblies, or, in the case of [[Kuwait]], a true legislature, increasing acknowledgement of the norms and observation of the monarch's activities. Rents have also been used effectively for development, and thus economic growth has bolstered stability. Nationalist and socialist movements, such as [[Baathism]], tend to have an ally-enemy dichotomy inherent to those who do not buy in, naturally creating an enemy elite clique with no incentive to work within the system: monarchies have generally tried to allow for balance and tolerance within the system. As elites have guaranteed property rites and rent in the monarchical system alongside greater political stability, there is a greater incentive for long term development, seeing greater economic growth under monarchy. The least modern political systems have fared best under liberal capitalism, possibly leading to future democratic reforms i.e. [[Kuwait]], [[Morocco]], and to a lesser extent the [[United Arab Emirates]].

## Analysis 
At p = .001, monarchy has 266% lower Conflict Index year-by-year. Fuel income per capita, population size, percent Muslim, and ethnic fractionalization are also controlled for. It uses country fixed events as well to control for underlying factors on a country level, in case monarchies are linked to other cofounding factors (don't fully understand this). Among countries that switched from republicanism to monarchy, monarchism was linked to more stability under the Conflict Index at the 5% significance level. He uses tribalism as a confounding factor for monarchism: as states with settled agriculture developed earlier, they tend nationalist, whereas in more recently agricultural countries the [[Bedouin]] had more control, leading to an increase in expected monarchism, to control for underlying factors in the transition to monarchy (I am unconvinced by this, the sample size is way too small. While the explanation is good why more fertile countries would have less monarchism, I don't buy that it is truly the best instrumental variable for MENA, and I think it's quite arbitrary.) Moving to monarchy is associated with a 16% decrease in likelihood of revolution, 11% of governmental crisis, 8% in assassination, and a 49% decrease in [[Guerilla Warfare]]. For economic results, the Quality of Government (QOG) Index from the International Country Risk Guide is used. Moving from non-monarchy to monarchy increases the QOG Index by one sigma, .13. Monarchy is correlated to economic growth at p=.05, as well as private credit and property rights.
