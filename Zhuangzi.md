# Zhuangzi
## Background
## Chapter Summaries
### 6
Perfection is to know the actions of humans and heaven.  Knowledge flourishes when you know what you don't know.  Being a "true" person entails asceticism and contentment, wuwei, not letting humanity or heaven "win".  Liking life entails liking death, as life cannot exist without death.  You cannot count the things that make you happy.  Disturbing peace is an idea similar to grasping death and irrelevence, blending life and death.  A master who became sick accepted it, as that was the way things were and there is nothing to dislike.  We should be auspicious material, and that means accepting the form of death.  Anti-Mengzi is an amazing name to give a person in the story.  Kongzi and Zigong are angry singing at the corpse for returning to its true form as it goes against ritual, the other masters say that it is in the spirit of ritual.  Kongzi wanders within rules, the singer outside, and they should not meet.  A man mourned without tears so deeply that he was remembered.  A return to the butterfly argument.  Kongzi praises a student for forgetting his own existance.

Perspective rules everything, and heavenly mechanisms confound observers.  Small victories (a frog in a well) can be hugely meaningful.  Giving perspective on something greater can disrupt that (sea = heaven?).  Prestige is worth less than safety (turtle in the mud).  It is impossible to know what someone knows.  Knowledge can come from disparite sources. 

### 18
Life and death are part of a natural cycle and so mourning is not necessary.
