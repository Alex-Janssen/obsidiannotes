# India, A Sacred Geography
## What is India
### Introduction
India's unique position as one of the most diverse countries on Earth has been recognize internally since BCE. The theme of the past two thousand years, both supported and criticized, is "unity in diversity." The [[Rg Veda]] spoke of one truth with many means of expression. Festivals include citizens of all faiths or none at all, and identities are fluid and overlapping. Fourteen major language groups are housed in the country with myriad races, religions, and castes. Diversity also partially led to conflict between India and [[Pakistan]] in the [[Indian-Pakistani Conflict]].  [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], in hoping to make India a secular state, grasped that India was never defined by pure [[Hinduism|Hindu]] belief. This pluralism has survived, but some fear has been declining as of late. India, thus, was not a culture, but an overarching civilization. Some would say Indian civilization is a veneer for a Hindu nation, or a secular Democratic one, or a colonial project, meanwhile Hindu pilgrims cross the land called India in search of common ritual, creating yet another unified answer to "What is India?". India has existed before the [[Mughal Empire]] and [[British Raj]], it has been formed by geographic and mythological truths. Bharata was used to describe the whole subcontinent in Sanskrit, showing that there was shared consciousness. Western definitions of India have generally come from Western perspectives from some people who never even set foot on the land. Missionaries saw in India converts, merchants wealth, spiritualists some wisdom missing in the West: all of these paradigms are fundamentally extractive. A British administrator told budding civil servants in the 1880s that there is not or was never an India, an idea both present in colonialist and post colonialist reasonings. This source seeks to build up the idea that there was unity by probing the ways in which a shared identity was displayed. Bharata was never a nation state, yet remained in use. Religion is a system of belief and ritual that binds people together in a cosmos. Some religions, like [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]], are highly universal (ecumenical), while [[Hinduism]] and [[Judaism]] are notably local (locative) religions and communities. Hinduism as a belief system is intimately intertwined with Indian geography. Tirthas, holy places, are found all across India, with pilgrims from all over the Hindu world travelling to them. Even colonizing religions in India have taken on local character on India's shores.
### Geography and Mythology
India is a land of mountains, rivers, hills, jungles, plains: practically any biome imaginable. These places are home to myriad legends, some famous, some local. The lands' stories interact and form a web of sacred stories. The [[Himalayas]], for instance, are thought of to be the abode of gods, and where [[Shiva]] lives. Other peaks are seen to have been transported from the Himalayas to other areas by gods. The Vindhayas hills were said to be mountains that reached so high that they were forced to bow to a sage Agastya who never returned. The [[Ganga]] was said to be sent from heaven to revive the dead and purify the living. River hymns (to one of the seven great rivers) present in the Rg Veda were said to be one of the first examples of Indian national consciousness. 
### Myths and Maps
Myths, like maps, orient people in their cosmos, just spiritually instead of geographically. Geographic knowledge was a tool of imperial control and locative representation. [[Varanasi]] has pilgrim maps that contain few roads but many temples, with Shiva's trident a reminder of Varanasi's separation from time and space. The map of India itself is often depicted with Bharat Mata, a melding of British scientific cartography and pictographic representation. Maps give attention to what is known which is represented and that which is unknown left in the margins. Ecumenical traditions often form a universalized map form, while closed cultures, such as China, develop self-centered conceptions of geography. While Rome or Mecca are central in Christianity and Islam, the sense of the middle kingdom and periphery is not. Almost all of the Hindu epics and puranas compiled over fifteen centuries describe the world and what is known and unknown. Are they works of geography? India was imagined to a be a petal in a central lotus island of the universe. Sanskrit literature described Indian practices from different parts, having a dual mode of India-ness while retaining diversity between the North and South, East and West. The study of Hindu geography and mythology has rarely intersected. 
### A Common and Complex Cosmos
This conception that India is a cosmic petal is present in [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]] alongside orthodox Hinduism, and the particular points of interest are also shared. Some ethnicities, particularly tribal groups, took on far more local conceptions of themselves and their histories. Toponyms were often seen to be sacred. In Indo-Muslim culture, Hindustan is not the abode of the gods but still is home to kings, relics, and martyrs. Some of these celebrated localities or characters were shared by Muslims and Hindus, and Indian Muslims, while tied to Mecca, also were tied to their homeland. [[Sikhism]], meanwhile, rejected the concept of holy places. Even yet, the [[Golden Temple]] at [[Amritsar]] gained sacred importance. Christians developed places of pilgrimage too. The theme of a living cosmos has adapted over time, and so too has the sacred geography of India. 
### Circling the Land
The idea of circumambulation (pradakshina, keeping the center to one's right), walking around some holy thing to show respect, is present in most Indian religious traditions. Temples, people, cities, or even rivers would be shown this respect. Some circumambulate across the entirety of India. Kings were said to circle the four directions, then a tool of political power, something which [[Ashoka]] did literally, a march of victory of [[Dharma]] and a marker of the beginning of his [[Buddhism]]. He left rock-cut inscriptions of commands. The [[Mahabharata]] also viewed travel as symbolic, with four brothers conquering the four directions by making a clockwise pilgrimage. Philosophers have done the same sort of symbolic journey to try to spread their teachings. The idea of marking the four directions was also present in the same manner. India is defined in the four directions, with four dhams, divine abodes of the gods. Thus, there are four great temples marking these abodes. The tradition is to make this pilgrimage on foot, although, of course, some cut corners nowadays. The extent of this tradition is unknown, but was almost certainly more common among renouncers than common citizens. Even [[Alexander the Great]] was told information about India in relation to both pilgrimage and the four directions, marking the age of the tradition.
### "What is India?"
Given the modern mindset of nation-states, one readily considers India one of these nations, ignoring its tremendous diversity. However, it is true that the perception of Indians is one of a unified nation in some sense, non-trivial considering these differences. British colonists and orientalists firmly rejected the idea of Indian nationhood, only possibly excepting the Mughal rule. An administrator argued that India was a meaningless, foreign-placed term with no Indian equivalent, something we have learned is roundly false. He paralleled Europe, saying that, for instance, [[Punjab]] and [[Bengal]] were more different than Spain and Scotland. This led to the idea that the [[British Raj]] didn't destroy any national idea, trample any national project of the Indian people. This was said at the same time of the beginning of the [[Indian National Congress]]. Bharata was derived from the name of a king, and originally only referred to Northern India. Every Hindu ritual begins with invoking this place as one's place while giving one's ritual intent. By the time of the Mahabharata and Puranas, Bharata referred to roughly the whole of India (everything north of the seas and south of the Himalayas). Even Southeast Asian Kingdoms sometimes included themselves in this definition, showing that the boundary was fluid. India, like Italy, has been fractured but a geographically consistent idea. This geography is crucial to Hindu self-identity. It is sometimes argued that pilgrimage was the primary factor in expanding the geographic bounds of "home."  [[Savakar]] viewed [[Hindutva]] as a union of those who share a love of fatherland, rather than Hindu religious affiliation. Nehru, travelling across the country, was struck by the union of all those who called India home, and during a Chinese-Indian border dispute Nehru told [[Zhou Enlai]] that the idea of India's border being the Himalayas had deep spiritual significance. A secular politician did not hesitate in using the unified sacred geography as a political tool.
### Tirthas
There are so many sacred spaces, tirthas, that their separation from the normal world is questionable. The world is, itself, in some way, sacred. In temples in tirthas, the location is as important as the building, or in many cases temples were built on long-standing holy sites. During the [[Gupta Period]], temple building increased as a tool of control, while not displacing alters or the natural world. Their cosmic symbolism meant that temples, beyond being a house for a deity, were a microcosm of the cosmos, reflected in their design. Circling the temple then, meant circling the world. 
### Hindustan
The Turko-Afghan armies of the 11th century brought their own conception of India. [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] sacked one of the wealthiest cities of Northern India, Kannauj, bringing a pattern of targeting the most holy cities. "Idols" were targeted, and "infidels" were killed. Total destruction was not the aim, but instead the removal of Hindu imagery from their holy contexts, to remove their power. Temples were desecrated selectively and politically, to delegitimize losing Indian dynasties, and thus temples were a target due to their geographic connotation. Many other powerful tirthas, meanwhile were hilltops or rivers, much less pervious to destruction.
### Bharat Mata
In 1936, the [[Bharat Mata]] temple was constructed as a pan-Indian pro independence space. It contained no icons but a large map of India, thus circumambulation meant circling the whole country symbolically. The temple is mostly now visited by tourists, not pilgrims. The temple had no ritual weight, and thus never became a popular spot of pilgrimage. Instead, the part that has taken hold is the map of India along with an anthropomorphic form (often the goddess [[Durga]]). This emblem became deeply embedded in Hindu nationalist movements.
