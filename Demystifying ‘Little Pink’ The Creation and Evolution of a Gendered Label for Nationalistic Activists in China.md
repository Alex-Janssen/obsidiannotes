# Demystifying ‘Little Pink’ The Creation and Evolution of a Gendered Label for Nationalistic Activists in China

## Introduction
Little Pink is a term for Chinese young women nationalists, typically less violent than other Online nationalist groups. Originating from a group discussing homosexual male romance, they have since targeted myriad groups, including [[Taiwan]]. However, this group is mostly imagined, a term of rebuke from this Taiwan conflict. Other groups, however, have leaned on femininity to promote Chinese nationalism.

## Digital activism and cyber-nationalism in China: creating the linkages
The narrative of [[China]] using the [[Great Firewall]] to clamp down on wiley Internet users is very studied, showing a mistrust of China towards Internet users. However, cyber-nationalism, contrary to trope, is a popular movement as well, which is understudied. Despite the presence of the [[Wumao]], cyber-nationalism is distinctly not identified with state power. The selection of labels for cyber-nationalists dictates its evolution, little pink was a part of this evolution. The state uses gender roles to support nationalism, and liberals online used gender roles to denegrate women and thus nationalism. Women are mostly ammunition in this fight: cyber-nationalism is completely male dominated.

## Methodological approach
Digital ethnography with analysis of forums, reading images and close reading nationalistic comments.

## The cross-strait memes war and the emergence of Little Pink label
A Taiwanese pop star was called Taiwanese on a Korean game show, prompting Mainland anger and a response by the singer calling the two sides of the Strait the same, prompting liberal Taiwanese anger. As a response to Facebook brigading, the idea of romance obsessed Mainland women writing these comments took hold. 64% of brigaders were male, most were foreign students. 

## The mistaken invention of Little Pink
Many used metaphors of seduction to talk about [[Chinese Unification]]. Some tried to show places in China to visit and foods to share. While some shared romance stories about China and Taiwan, others took to typical nationalist anger.

## Little Pink label takes on a life of its own: the liberals attack
Little Pink contrasts with the braver [[Red Guards]], pink being a shade lighter. Protesters against the [[Bombing of the Belgrade Chinese Embassy]] were frightening, little pink was funny. They were seen as not properly developed or from poorer rural China or 3rd/4th tier cities. They only loved their country and didn't have true political opinions. The [[Chinese Communist Party]] also boosted the term. The only prominent woman in this discourse discouraged its use due to problematic gender issues.

## How the real Little Pink reacted
Most users were still more interested in gay romance than nationalism and didn't like the label. 

## Conclusion and discussion
The term morphed from a popular insult to one appropriated by the party for all youthful nationalists. The label feminized discourse about unification, even if participants weren't women. Imagined groups like little pink can empower and disempower groups, and are altering cyber-nationalism today.
