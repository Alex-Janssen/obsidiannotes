### Introduction
The decision of where to start the "Early Modern" period is hugely up for debate, the [[Fall of Constantinople]], the arrival of [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] [[Conquistador|Conquistadors]] are Eurocentric examples, some may say the death of [[Timur]] or the [[Ming Treasure Voyages]]. [[Adam Smith]] saw the Early Modern age as typified by European colonialism ravishing native societies on their path to construct empires. The capitalist view is of human progress being driven by the impulse of commerce and impeded by [[Mercantilism]]. The [[Hegiran Calendar]] saw a change in century, with it claims of Millenarianism from [[Suleiman the Great]] and [[Akbar]]. Akbar hoped for commerce between the Asiatic and European worlds, and saw truth to derive from multiple religions, seeing religion as something gained from birth rather than a search for the truth. This is emblematic of the inter-imperial competition typified from 1400-1800, with multiple powerful empires rising but none gaining hegemony. Despite the [[Spanish Empire]] ruling over the widest territory from 1580-1640, it didn't dominate other powers of the time. It is faulty to see the era through one location, or to see the era solely through the lens of unification and imperialism: equally prevalent were forces of separation and division.
[[Magellan's Voyage]] may have had the greatest impact on the perception of space of any event in world history: it proved the unity of all locations on Earth. Although having less immediate impact on colonial projects, it is an epoch defining moment in the sense of the Early Modern period's increasing globalization. It created direct links between Asia and the Americas, influencing both. The mines of [[Potosi]] shaped the Spanish Empire both in the wealth they brought and the inflation and instability they brought Spain and the world (including the [[Ottoman Empire]]). A large destination of Potosi's silver was China, through the Manila-Acapulco link. Traders and merchants take center stage in this era as a result. Braudel viewed zones as world-economies, entirely interlinked and self-sufficient systems, i.e. the historic [[Indian Ocean]] trade, with conflicts occurring at their borderlands. Wallerstein's history treats European capitalism as the driving force of the world, with fringes of the world system being brought into the fold. Thus, non-European actors were seen as nearly entirely passive entities, drawing criticism. A pure [[Core-Periphery Model]] is insufficient to describe, for instance, the relationship between the [[Mughal Empire]] and [[Safavid Persia]]. Non-Western-European traders, such as [[Gujarat|Gujarati]] and [[Armenia|Armenian]] traders, were dynamic in response to European competition, and the difference in technology is often not as clear as traditionally said.
Population demographics are notoriously hard to calculate, but by estimate, the 1400s had a slightly lower population than the 1200s, largely due to the [[Black Plague]], and world population went from 375m in 1400 to 954m in 1800. The American population collapse in the 1500s was the largest downtrend, and Asia grew the most over this period. [[India]] and China likely comprised more than half of the world population. Thus, if even counting population is controversial, economic output is even more so. Pomeranz argues that the European relative supremacy in living quality diverged from Asia and Africa later than often thought, and had no roots in particular institutions or traits of Europe but was mainly due to the cheapness of crucial goods brought by colonial projects. Material on quantitative measures of quality of life in many regions is scarce enough that questions lend themselves to qualitative analysis.

### Silver in a Global Context
Since its manufacture in [[Cappadocia]] 4000 years before, silver was the primary mean of exchange prior to the emergence of the Gold Standard in the late 1800s. China was a huge destination of silver traditionally, but during [[Yuan Dynasty]] rule Mongol rulers exported Chinese silver due to demand from [[Persia]] and [[Spain]] and the substitution of paper money. In the 1430s, the Chinese economy tanked amid an overproduction of silver-backed paper currency and small silver reserves, leading to a resumption of Chinese importation of the metal and [[Joseon Korea|Korean]] production of it. This activity may have spurred European investment as well. [[Japan]] shifted from an importer to an exporter in the 1400s as a major mine was discovered. China consuming so much silver consistently was a major impetus to the trade journeys emblematic of the Early Modern age, with [[Potosi]], which produced one-half of the world's silver at its peak, fueling Chinese demand and creating an America-Asia trade connection. The Spanish Empire was fuelled on the production value-cost arbitrage on silver. The discovery of silver in Japan was a centralizing force for the Shogun, helping end the [[Sengoku Jidai]], with Portuguese and later Dutch intermediaries profiting too. Traditionally, silver is seen as a response to trade imbalance, making up for trade deficits which are causal. However, this chapter examines a supply-demand argument where silver itself is causal to its trade, and isn't merely a stand-in for a lack of European products in Asian trade. Gold, silver, and cowry shells are geologically distributed in certain areas of the world, and thus there is not equivalent access to these materials. China held onto silver but not gold, and thereby demanded silver but was a supplier of gold, different from India, thereby bolstering supply-demand dynamics. Money, therefore, is not a monolith, silver, gold, and cowry shells had different sources of demand and supply and didn't merely counterbalance trade: this misunderstanding hampers a broader appreciation of monetary history. Trade deficits did not exist in the Early Modern period as the system of global finance was not mature: this is not like the [[American Debt]] where the US truly does owe money for net imports. Prices of monies are equal to prices of commodities. Consumption demand impacts inventory supply, and inventory demand is the amount of stockpile desired which is acted upon by purchase demand, three quantities traditionally lumped into a nebulous demand function. The trade that was stimulated by silver introduced American maize, peanuts, and sweet potatoes played a huge role in China's tremendous growth in population and doubling of landmass.
