# Imjin War

## Introduction
The Imjin War was a major conflict between the [[Joseon Korea]] and [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi|Hideyoshi's]] [[Japan]]. It lasted between 1592-1598, and is seen as a foudnational moment in Korean national identity. In Korea it is seen as a "Japanese Disturbence," Japan as the "Bunroku Era Campaign" and the beginning of [[Japanese Colonization of Korea]], and China as "Joseon's Wanli Campaign" and a symbol of China's protection of Korea. 

## Course of Events
After the [[Sengoku Jidai]], Japan was a decentralized nation, gaining [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[Portugal|Portuguese]] missionaries. [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] arguably invaded Japan for general control over Asia and later the world, but also to consolidate power and to use many unemployed soldiers, many of whom originated from lands controlled by formerlly hostile Daimyos. Japan first landed 160k soldiers at [[Busan]] on May 23rd, with [[Seoul]] falling on June 12th. Every land battle was a defeat for the Koreans. [[Manchu]] [[Jurchens]] were a greater concern for Korea, and thus their armed forces were adapted for fighting Northern nomadic tribes, not battle-hardened modern militaries. The Ming decide to send aid, and Yi Sunshin becomes active. The Ming send 3,000 troops on late 1592, but draw 51,0000 troops on January 1593 after a major defeat in [[Pyongyang]]. Korean sea control was strong, despite continued Japanese land control. There was an armistice and 1594-1596, with negotiations between Ming and Japan. Hideyoshi has 7 conditions, with partition creating a Japanese Southern Korea. Ming and Japanese diplomats forge different demands, with Wanli accepting Japanese tributary state relations in the forged demand. The Ming envoy is illterate and tries to enfeof Toyotomi, which leads to the resumption of the war. The Second Offensive (1597-1598) only sought to control Southern Korea, not control all of China.

## Korean Views
[[Yi Sunshin]] lead a famous naval campaign, helping secure independence. He was seen as a [[Confucianism|Confucian]] paradigm, a good person prevailing despite a corrupt government. 

## Japanese Views
It is seen as a peripheral event in Japanese history, with [[Japanese Historiography]] using this war as justification for further colonization. Japan needed to bring Korea into the fold. [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] lead the war after the unification post-[[Sengoku Jidai]]. 

## Chinese Views
[[China]] places little emphasis on the war, with the [[Ming Dynasty]] having fulfilled its duty as Korea's tributary overload. It is linked with the PRC's aid of [[North Korea]] during the [[Korean War]].

## Legacy
This war showed the Ming's decline and the increase of power of the [[Jurchens]], who would later found the [[Qing Dynasty]]. Ming and Korea became closer, and in Japan [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] would later take control. It devestated Korea, but also lead to Korean movement to Japan and movement of goods (firearms, tobacco, chili peppers). Neo-Confucianism, the state ideology of Joseon, also spreads mildly to Japan. Slavers took advantage of the world, including [[Portugal|Portuguese]] slavers.
