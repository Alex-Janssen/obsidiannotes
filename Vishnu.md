# Vishnu
## Traits
Vishnu was largely the inheritor of [[Indra|Indra's]] traits as a primary protector god. Vishnu was partially raised by the Mahabharata as a god to protect against demons. He was once a dwarf who was allowed by demons to take three steps to guarantee the sacrificial enclosure of the world, but he grew to encompass the whole world in three steps. Vishnu incarnated himself as [[Krishna]] and [[Rama]]], embodying the concept of [[Avatara]], and Vishnu generally lived full human lives if needed, showing his assimilation with society. Vishnu was seen as a preserver god, unlike Shiva's change. Vishnu, as Krishna, argued that fighting for a correct cause did not impede [[Moksa]]. Different avatars of Vishnu are often given different, identifiable [[Yantra|yantras]]. 
## History
In the [[Rg Veda]], Vishnu was mentioned, albeit as a more side deity.  [[Shiva]] and Vishnu worship arose during the Gupta age, alongside the rise of [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], with many kings both professing belief in Vishnu and patronizing Buddhist temples. Puranic literature focused much more heavily on Vishnu and Shiva's worship. The Hindu epics were some of the first pieces of literature that primarily focused on Vishnu. By the time of temple Hinduism in 700 CE, Vishnu and Shiva worship was mainstream, and temples to both were seen to bring them to one's realm and thus use them against one's foes, as temples were seen as physical houses for gods. At the same time, while travelling poets wished for greater intimacy with Vishnu and Shiva, it was known that they were, on some level, unknowable.
