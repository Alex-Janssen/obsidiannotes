# 79 Primaveras

## Scenes
Starts with flowers and a bomb dropping, immediately putting the American "aggressors" against [[Vietnam]] in focus.
We then cut to a time lapse of [[Ho Chi Minh]] aging over the years, interplaying with the title. It mostly focuses on videos of him in his older years, showing him writing.
Parts of his poetry, along with those of [[José Martí]], are interspersed through the movie.
	"Yo le doy a mi pueblo toda mi vida"
We switch to a military march and music.
Then we go to the founding of the early Vietnamese communist party in [[Hong Kong]] among other early historic events.
Years will cut with (# primaveras), echoing the age of Ho Chi Minh at that time. 
First time the voice is heard is during the declaration of independence, (giving Vietnam a voice). This is immediately cut with battle noise.
After the war, the Internationale plays, along with a presumably Cuban singer singing in celebration.
We then cut to mutilated people by napalm, with distressed faces, showing the brutality of the [[Vietnam War]].
Soldiers are told to be "killing for victory." We see an American soldier beating a civilian.
Then soldiers are "killing because they cannot win."
American protesters in the [[Anti-Vietnam War Protests]] are shown along with American police brutality.
A police man is projected with a skull, then a soldier shoots a dead body repeatedly. American patriotic music plays.
A Ho Chi Minh poem about suffering winter to appreciate spring is shown.
Civilians are shown crying while a speech is made. Liberty is achieved. Flowers blossom. 
Ho Chi Minh dies. [[Fidel Castro]] is shown honoring his grave.
"Death is not true when one has accomplished the work of one's life." [[José Martí]].
Crowds are shown burning American flags. Police are beating protesters. Draft cards are burned.
In more battle scenes, the images themselves are fractured and disrupted. We then see it put back together with the quotation that bookended this part, "that the fracturing of the socialist camp should not supersede the future."
"The yankees are defeated. We will construct a country ten times as beautiful."

## Analysis
As a person who strongly opposes the message of the movie, it is absolutely masterfully crafted propaganda. The juxtaposition of Marti and Ho Chi Minh as poets and guerrillas who fought for liberty is very smart, the contrast between the death caused by Americans and the spring of liberty caused by Ho Chi Minh themselves, and broad ideas of socialist solidarity prove a strong point. Showing the US as internally divided with protesters and comparing that to the warning to not let the socialist camp divide was strong too. There were 79 Springs, which are appreciated after "glacial winters," repeated again and again in Vietnam's history.
