# Mao's Legacy
## Guiding Questions
What is Mao's place in China now?
What did Mao want his place to be?

## Thoughts
Mao clearly was obsessed with his legacy. His focus on memorizing quotations, revolutionising the educational system, and, perhaps most importantly, picking a successor that was defanged was meant to make his personality cult last in perpetuity. Mao originally intended for [[Zhou Enlai]] or Lin Biao to succeed him, but over time soured on both (even creating a huge anti-Lin Biao sentiment in the campaign to Criticize Lin Biao and [[Confucius' Analects|Confucius]]). Eventually, [[Hua Guofeng]] was chosen as a suitable, mild, pro-Mao candidate.
[[Deng Xiaoping]] took Hua Guofeng's role quickly after Mao's death. While he needed to appease some pro-Maoist members of the party, both the victory of _Practice_ over the staunchly Maoist "Two Whatevers" championed by Hua and the later efforts to study party history with [[Hu Yaobang]]. Crucially, Deng went less far than Hu in criticizing Mao while maintaining that the [[Cultural Revolution]] and [[Great Leap Forward]] were mistakes. Deng viewed a positive image of Mao as a stabilizing force of China, but Mao's ideological fingerprint on the country was, by then, effectively scrubbed off.
