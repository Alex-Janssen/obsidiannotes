# Mohism and Confucianism
## Guiding Questions
How do Mozi and [[Confucianism]] rely on ancient wisdom?  How do they justify this as being right?
How does social mobility differ in Mozi's text vs the Analects?  How should society be run?
## Ideas
[[Mozi]] uses the Sage Kings much like [[Confucius' Analects]] refers to the Odes, as a source of ancient wisdom.  
However, Mozi seems to stress promoting those who are righteous.  Beyond Kongzi's relative apathy with regards to the righteousness of rulers, Mozi stresses their active commitment to stability.  Mohism in general seems to be much more top down than down up, as in Mozi stresses the benevolence of the monarchs and capability of the government as the prime ingredient for stability, wheras Kongzi stresses filial piety and ritual in order to guarantee inner peace and lack of rebellion.
Mozi fundamentally rejects filial piety.  Instead, in [[Mozi#16]], he states that impartial love is necessary, or loving others' families as much as your own, as that would destroy the evils of stealing and violence against others.  [[Mengzi]] responds by stating that humans first learn compassion from kin, and thus it is human nature to love family more.  Thus, impartial caring contradicts this natural bend toward family.
