# The Bukharan Crisis, A Connected History of 18th Century Central Asia

## Introduction
Early-modern focus on Central Asia generally fixates on the collapse of [[Silk Road]] trade and it as a passive entity, which is overstated. Central Asian and [[Bukharan Khanate|Bukharan]] political economy are vastly understudied. Early modern Central Asia was active in interregional trade, and in some ways became more prominent. Connected histories need to be taken into account, not just local historical approaches. Early modern in this context is between the fall of the [[Timurid Empire]] and the [[Russian Colonization of Central Asia]]. [[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]] actors had a disproportionate role in this time period, and it is sometimes called the Uzbek Period. Early modern global dynamics affected Central Asia, for example increasing agricultural land use. Administrative centralization, standard language and ethnic consciousness, growth in urban areas were symptomatic in all of Eurasia. Traditional attempts to tie contemporary Uzbek states with earlier ones promulgated the idea that Uzbek states were backward, tribal, feudalistic creations, ignoring the consciouness that Central Asians had of changes globally, even during the [[Bukharan Crisis]]. The Silk Road can be seen through a Central Asian lens, both classically and in this period where Chingissid legitimacy died, Inner Asian nomads replaced by [[Russia]] and the [[Qing Dynasty]].

## Bukhara in Crisis
[[Zahir al-Din Muhammad Babur]] both oversaw the death of the [[Timurid Empire]] as its prince and the founding of the [[Mughal Empire]] as its leader. Islam spread in the region in the 14th century. The [[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]] invasion of the 1500s was the last major steppe invasion into settled areas, including [[Samarkand]], [[Timur|Timur's]] former beloved capital. The [[Bukharan Khanate]] was one of these Uzbek states, differing from other Islamic powers in that the ruler's family often ruled over regions with near autonomy. After overstretching, regional powers punished and took back some lands from the Uzbeks. The Khanate, when faced with no legitimate heirs, took a man from a different Chinggisid lineage as leader. Bukhara was its capital after 1599, with Balkh being the second most important city. Magnificient architecture originates from this period (and before). [[Sufism|Sufi]] orders had significant support. The Uzbek amirs, who enthroned the Toqay-Timurids, began to question their loyalty, starting a decentralizing trend. 1681 saw a major defeat by [[Khiva]], leading to the king abdicating and Subhan Quli Khan taking his place. All of Subhan Quli Khan's sons were killed in infighting. 1688 saw the de-facto independence of much of Bukharan territory, i.e. the [[Ferghana Valley]]. Balkh increasingly slipped out of Bukharan control, and amirs kept engineering the fall of khans in the early 1700s. 1708 and 1716 saw the Jungar Mongols invade and briefly occupy [[Tashkent]], amirs in Shahrisabz declared independence in 1722, Jungars occupied enough [[Kazakhstan|Kazakh]] lands in 1723 to cause a major flight, leading to a key component in modern Kazakh identity. Kazakhs regain control and conquer Uzbek-Bukharan land starting in 1727, turning from persecuted to persecuters. [[Nadir Shah]] overthrows [[Safavid Persia]] in 1736, later invading Khiva and Bukhara in 1740. The Toqay-Timurid dynasty truly ended in 1747.
Many scholars believed that the irrelevance of the Silk Road due to maritime trading caused economic stress that led to the crisis. Western scholars had even more reductionist traits, seeing society as passive and not worth studying in the 1980s/90s. Decline is discussed, in contemporary setttings, primarily among political elites in a capital, and rarely have bearing on actual quality of life (is that problematic? I associate decline with political, not QoL). Regional outcomes during the Bukharan crisis strongly varied. Central Asian market prices for goods, ie. tobacco, generally followed those of the world, and the Indian horse trade push back on ideas of economic isolation. Some scholars still hold onto traditional beliefs of decline or believe that global history is more likely to be covering shoddy work rather than actually innovating in the field. Central Asia was not a hotspot, but it was not isolated.

## Silk Roads, Real and Imagined
Studies on the Silk Road explain the Eurasian trasnmission of goods, ideas, religion among other trends. The Silk Road, despite being a Western idea, is presented in terms of trade with China, with Central Asia being seen as only relevant within this Chinese system. The Silk Road is here conceptualized as a multi-layered system between sedentary and nomadic Central Asian actors alongside its periphery.
The [[Han Dynasty]] annexed [[Xiongnu]] territory, traditionally seen as enabling the Silk Road. An 1877 [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] conception of the Silk Road is the origin of the modern intellectual idea. There were many routes and many non-silk goods traded, with Central Asian gems being popular in Mesopotamia and [[India]]. Due to its impreciseness, some scholars wish to dismiss the term, but its popularity makes that unlikely. Recognizing that the majority of trade was local, there was a globalizing nexus identifiable with Central Asia as its heart. The lack of Central Asian merchant records due to secrecy hurts commercial-historical approaches. The traditional narrative leads to ideas of Central Asian decline happening as their economic engine would have had to have been the rent-seeking off of Chinese-European luxury good trade.
Bartold's history of Central Asia was deeply influential and used his brilliance with languages to examine sources. He was deeply positivist. He saw his contemporaries as being biased against [[Islam]]. Tolz saw Bartold seeing Russia as a Eurasian nation, its conquest of Central Asia being not a colonial project but a natural expansion and modernization in a [[Social Darwinism|Social Darwinist]] sense. 
Other histories have forgotten the commercial history aspect. Included is Lost Enlightenment: Central Asiaâ€™s Golden Age from the Arab Conquests to Tamerlane (listened winter 2023), which connects sedentary prosperity to agriculture and the Silk Road trade, the world's entrepot, with its decline being seen as dually caused by anti-free trade attitudes and religious conservatism. The extent to which free trade was practiced by the empires studied or that it was rejected by the Mongols is controversial. Another study sees the Silk Road as an unremarkable collection of local roads, occasionally unmarked, from one city to the next. Hansen argues that the Silk Road was one of the least travelled routes in history by cargo or number of travellers, not worthy of independent study, undermining ideas that its decline could have caused the fall of Central Asia. A letter by a merchant showed a small exchange, possibly insinuating smaller trade (wholly unconvincing, show me a retail investor's stock purchase and say the NASDAQ isn't big, addressed in the source as well).
A Sinocentric position of China's trade west cannot support the idea of a relevant silk road, a Central Asian perspective can, giving it agency in the Early Modern era.

## Early Modern Silk Road
The Silk Road is a Sino (and Indo) centric concept based on orientalist ideas that this was the main engine behind the Central Asian economy. Bulk merchandise was traded more than luxury goods, and Central Asian actors were active in the trade (don't think that's controversial). [[Babur]] went to [[Kabul]] and noted the prosperity of it as an entrepot. [[Potosi]] produced 60% of the European silver stock in 1500 (see [[Cambridge World History, VI, The Construction of a Global World#Silver in a Global Context]]). East Asian markets were critical sources of demand for American silver. Silver was a critical store of value in [[India]], which produced many desired commodities but had little natively. The [[VOC]] lamented how their trade did not displace [[Persia|Persian]] caravan trade in 1639. Central Asia and [[Safavid Persia]] had immense trade ties. They were both low population (5-10 million) and had weaker domestic markets. Indian and Central Asian ties increased when they would have supposedly collapsed in the 17th century (is this a view actually held?). Multani merchants operated in Central Asia, using locals, [[Tartars]], [[Armenian Diaspora|Armenians]] among others. The horse trade boomed in the Early Modern era. Indian conditions were severe for horses, making Central Asian imports important, as Central Asia had enough land to dedicate to grazing, not had in India and China. The Indian connections remained, even after the fall of Bukhara. The treaty of Nerchinsk allowed Russo Chinese trade (see [[Boundaries, Maps, and Movement, Chinese, Russian, and Mongolian Empires in Early Modern Central Eurasia]]), with Chinese rhubarb (from seminar, some in Qing thought Europeans needed rhubarb to survive, blockade would be deadly), Siberian furs, and Chinese tea being major commodities. Nomadic trade was seen as smmuggling by the [[Qing Dynasty]] but was still a major force. Central Asian markets allowed for Russian goods to pass to [[Xinjiang]]. 
The [[Nogai]] were not needed for the horse trade as much due to the Russian conquest of [[Astrakhan]] (where many Bukharan merchants passed and stayed), but the horse trade was only a part of Russia's interaction with Central Asian livestock economics. After the 1759 end of the Qing's campaign in Central Asia, [[Kazakhs]] were the main supplier of livestock. Russia encouraged Muslim Bukharan merchant immigration to sparsely population regions in Siberia. Trade was invited to [[Orenburg]] instead of Astrakhan, with many Bukharans and Indians following. 
Bukharan trade with Siberia flourished during the crisis, when travel was dangerous. Networks and relationships were seen as stable, thus merchants had confidence in their safety. Destabilization complled outward trade, increasing Bukharan intellectual influence abroad (net positive is doubtful imo). The VOC's stranglehold over documentation in the Indian Ocean contributed to ideas of Western domination over its trade (see [[In Asian Waters, Oceanic Worlds from Yemen to Yokohama]]). The English became dominant in [[Bengal]], developing [[Kolkata]] into a major center. Likely the Persian-Indian cloth trade was three times greater than the Bengal-European one: caravan trading was alive in the 18th century. Central Asian trade, despite being in a non-favorable location climate wise, moved with the global economy and had a part in a thriving caravan trade. Most trade was bulk. If this Silk Road didn't collapse, why did Bukhara?

## The Crisis Revisited
Early Modern Central Asian trade echoed earlier periods: early modern polities were much weaker than the [[Timurid Empire]]. Gunpowder weaponry gave actors like [[Safavid Persia]] parity with nomadic fighters. Timurid and other polities followed a highly decentralized power sharing compared to the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Safavid Persia]]. Bukharan attempts to raise taxes in response to military threats failed and alienated Uzbeks. Contemporary writers saw Central Asia as an impovrished backwater. His accounts were filtered through nobles in Bukhara in the height of the crisis (doesn't make me question credibility: he can see). Saying the region was "in decline" is overly general, painting the region with one experience of the Bukharan Crisis. The Ferghana Vallye gained immigrants from Samarqand, its gain, including the prosperity of [[Khoqand]]. The first half of the 1700s saw Qing China grow in economy 50%, doubled in population from 140 to 260 million people, necessitating bronze to take the role of silver ( D: ). Silver demand caused Central Asian silver to flow to China, eventually depleting domestic sources. Silver purity dropped from 90% purity in 1605 to 30% 1699 with examples of lower later. [[Nadir Shah]] sacking [[Delhi]] in 1739 increased silver quality in the mid 1700s, exported for Russian demand in Orenburg. Decrease in Chinese demand meant Central Asians could retain silver more easily as well. Nadir Shah, instead of spending gains on infrastructure, used it to buy loyalty, injecting silver into the economy. Safavid-Central Asian trade was peripheral, and thus the [[Collapse of Safavid Persia]] was muted in its effect on Central Asian commercial history, and the [[Mughal Empire]] remained commercially active after its decline: these were minor contributors to the crisis, more important was the Chinese silver demand.
Contemporary accounts were often polemic and blamed incompetence or laziness. Climate change may have been an ignored factor. The [[Little Ice Age]] created famine in the Ming dynasty and throughout the world. Harvest failures and rebellions, more than lack of silver, caused the [[Ming-Qing Transition]]. India also marginally affected. This may have undermined the Bukharan agricultural economy. Central Asia may have been severly affected with cold, damp winters in 1647, with nomads losing their herds and sedentary crops failing, sporadically continuing until perhaps 1740. This may have partially contributed the Dzungar-Kazakh wars in 1723, a major contributor. 
Gunpowder eroded nomadic military advantage, lacking industry to produce sufficient weapons. Firearms seemed to have little presence in Central Asia, for instance the Battle of [[Merv]] in 1510. Uzbeks used mortars in the siege of [[Herat]] in 1587. Russian gunpower overpowered Kazakh's in 1740. Dzungars embraced gunpowder weapons. Russians used guns as they were easier to train peasants with than bows, along with wars against powers like [[Sweden]] this caused familiarity with the tool. In debt: Bukharan khans paid military with promesary notes in the late 1600s. In the wake of Nadir Shah's return in 1740, the killing of Chinggisid lineage, the rapid silver inflation in the wake of Nadir Shah's capture of Delhi, and reorganization of a Safavid-like, diverse musket army were major turning points. This collapse lead to literature of the Timur-Nama, raising [[Timur]] to legendary status, pining for past glories.
The flow of mental constructs bolsters the point of connected histories. Science production and foreign knowledge discovery continued despite decentralization in Bukhara.

## Conclusion
Central Asia of this time was the victim of a single story of decline. The Bukharan capital declined, but not necessarily all of its people would have perceived this. Increases in mobility of people and goods, Iberian colonialism, demographic changes, proto-capitalism affects this story. The Silk Road collapsing is an oft-repeated trope in Central Asian history. Horse and livestock demand and other good trade was robust even if the specific silk trade declined. Nonetheless, Chinggisid Bukharan leadership collapsed in the early 1700s. Ecological factors led to Central Asia not adopting gunpowder rapidly: a small population and small taxbase with traditions of horsepower and a surplus of horses. Bukharan attempts to adapt sped up decentralization by Uzbek amir resistence. An influx of Mughal silver was too late to save leadership. Despite puppet leadership extending to 1785, Chinggisid leadership de-facto ended in 1747, with the [[Bukharan Amirate]] taking its place. The Uzbek Ming (no relation to Chinese dynasty, tribe name) became powerful, eventually forming the [[Khanate of Khoqand]], which would emerge, flourish, and also fall.
