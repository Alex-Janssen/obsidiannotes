# Pure Land Buddhism
Pure Land Buddhism is a sect of Buddhism focused on rebirth in a "Buddha-Field," a cosmos inhabited and created by a Buddha. Amitabha is a principle Buddha in practice: instead of years of struggle to gain enlightenment in other [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] sects only moments of thought are needed to be guaranteed enlightenment in the other world. Amitabha is above, in a way, [[Siddhartha Gautama]], with the enlightenment of practitioners reliant on his intercession on death. It is a sect of [[Mahayana Buddhism]], which preached enlightenment for anyone willing to acknowledge 10 pure moments of thought. This was a universalizing sect, and a response to the death of [[Siddhartha Gautama]]. Death is necessary to be reborn: Amitabha will accompany you to be reborn in the pure land to the West (not related to India's direction, see [[Journey to the West]]).
Pure Land Buddhism was popularized in China and [[Japan]].
Nianfo is the repetition of Amitabha's name in order to venerate him and gain enlightenment (compare with recitation of [[Rama]]). This recitation is often communal. 
Visionary experience is highly important as well: visualizing a Buddha helps gain enlightenment. Visualizing a Buddha is the Buddha, visualizing a Buddha transforms earth into a pure land.
This world should be seen as pure as well.
Ways of gaining virtue:
Caring for one's parents, elders, not killing, doing 10 good deeds.
3 refuges, keeping precepts, etc.
