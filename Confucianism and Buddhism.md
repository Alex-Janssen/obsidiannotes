# Confucianism and Buddhism
## Guiding Questions
How was [[Buddhism]] adopted as a popular force in China and Vietnam?
How did [[Confucianism|Confucian]] bureaucracy tolerate Buddhism?
Was there mutual influence?

## Thoughts
Keay mentions a [[Song Dynasty]] Confucian scholar and high court official (Ouyang Xiu) who identify Buddhism as a sort of "opiate of the masses" (Keay 313).  
This has fascinating interplay with the nominally Confucian [[Dai Viet]] constantly in conflict with Buddhism (despite some rulers elevating it), which was a rural religion.  Confucianism allowed the Dai Viet court to centralize power and enforce meritocracy, and Buddhism was often antithetical to power.  Buddhism (and Hinduism) had sway in [[Champa]] and the South, wheras Confucianism was a Chinese influence, due to Chinese dynastic tributary relations with Dai Viet.
