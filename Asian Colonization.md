# Asian Colonization
## Guiding Questions
How did the colonization of South and Southeast Asia impact their modern societies?
Can we see China and other centralized Asian states as being colonizers themselves?
How were non-colonized states, such as Japan, China, and Thailand, effected by colonization?
## Thoughts
China has traditionally sought expansion using a system of tributaries, and directly administered "barbarian" lands, forcing Chinese culture and customs.  This is readilly apparent in Vietnam, where [[Dai Viet]] was very influenced by China.  [[Confucianism]] was often upheld over the local Northern [[Buddhism]] and Southern [[Hinduism]] as a model for bureaucracy.  Dai Viet often conquered in the name of their illustrious, civilized "Han" civilization against the dastardly barbarians who did not slot into this tributary system (this was not a signal of Vietnamese sense of inferiority).
The French used persecution of Catholics to occupy [[Dai Nam]], wheras their actual motivations were clearly in order to expand the French industrial base and increase naval power, including prestige.  Religion is a convenient reason for colonization, and was often used as a justification for European involvement with Christian minority populations.
