# Asian Values and the Asian Crisis, A Confucian Humanist Perspective
The author argues of a unique strain of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] modernization, refusing to see modernization and other globalizing forces as inherently acultural (i.e., [[Japan]] originally taking [[Westernization]] to the extreme of discussions of abandoning the Japanese language to possibly being the most culturally distinctive "Global North" country). While acknowledging the power of pure economic or governmental models, the author notes of certain predictions of success of the [[Four Asian Tigers]] solely by knowing of their shared Sinitic background. Emphasis on self-cultivation and education helps Confucian societies develop a civil society, something which a market society (not economy, but pure obsession) cannot. As well, the author states that a continuation of Chinese authoritarianism by the [[Chinese Communist Party]] would be disastrous despite [[Deng Xiaoping|Deng Xiaoping's]] opening.
