## Thoughts
[[Deng Xiaoping]] sought to modernize China using examples from the West, eschewing Maoism which itself was meant to modernize the country from the earlier dynastic system to a [[Maoism|Maoist]] example state.
Vietnam was seen as being modernized by the French traditionally, and it is true that the French provided beneficial development.  However, China as well provided Confucian-style bureaucracy and advanced technology during their interactions with Jiaozhi and [[Dai Viet]], a similar colonial style relationship but from an Asian context.  Vietnam could be seen as a colonizer state, conquering Champa and Tai lands and settling populations.
