## Sounds and Statue in Hinduism
In Hinduism, there is an idea that statues are the abodes for gods, and these statues are animated by ritual. The sound is said to be vibrating, with stone being affected by and returning the sacred sound: frequent ritual thus replenishes shakti. In Tamil ritual, meaning of mantras is not emphasized: the gods are embodied via sound, sent to a statue, and awakened by blood sacrifice. There is a difference between the calm, Brahmanic deities and violent, unpredictable village deities which are often not directly worshipped due to fear. Materiality is important, with the act of transforming clay central to certain peoples' conceptions of this divinity. The statues are animated forms of the deities. These deities can, when the times come, be transferred from statues to water in an inverse ritual according to some, others disagree. Clay is often used as village deities are seen to inhabit the soil, thus are imbued directly into the material. (Venkatesan)
