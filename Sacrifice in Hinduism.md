# Sacrifice in Hinduism
## Aryan Religion
The Aryan migrants, seeking force against their Dasa indigenous neighbors, largely focused on warrior gods. Sacrifice was used as a tool to venerate gods such as [[Indra]], a prototypical warrior god. Soma, a quasi-psychadelic plant, was used in sacrifices, beginning a trend that alternate states of consciousness could be more real than normal reality.

## Sacrifice in Agricultural Society
As Indian civilization went from primarily nomadic to agricultural, surplus was able to be used in sacrifice while a religious class of brahmans could be upheld. Sacrifice as a tool was seen to be a tool of power, a dramatic show of force to unify their lands. The [[Rg Veda]] stated that humanity originated from a primordial sacrifice, for instance. Sacrifice ranged from domestic fire rituals to empire wide lavish sacrifices. Some gods would be praised by sacrifice while others were malevolent and had to be appeased. The Varna [[Caste System]] was said to originate from a human sacrifice, each caste originating from a different part of the body. In the Upanishads era, [[Karma]] originated as a way to reward proper sacrifice in [[Samsara]]. [[Moksa]] broke from sacrifice's collective religious burden, instead focusing on individual action. 
Ritual could be seen as a way of petitioning the gods. These sacrifices were highly mechanical and ritualized, and were often seen more as a way of mechanically guaranteeing worldly benefits rather than directly reaching the gods. Thus, ritual itself does not have to have meaning or to be understood. Soma, the ritual substance, is a god to be consumed, and agni, or fire itself, is the consumer. (Lecture 28.2)

## Sacrifice in New Hinduism
As sacrifice was seen to aid gods, some argued that [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], both of which rejected the need of sacrifice, were birthed in order to prevent some malevolent spirits from gaining too much power. [[Vishnu]], often revered as the primary god, was associated with guaranteeing the world as a space safe for sacrifice to the gods. 
By the time of Temple Hinduism, the authoritative aspect of sacrifice was replaced by temple sponsorship. Puja, as well, often stood in for sacrifice.

## Forms of Sacrifice
Sacrifice is considered any ritual giving up something of value. Most Vedic rituals have some sacrificial component, a common trend in agrarian civilization. Grain or milk was often offered in fire, along with animal sacrifice (which [[Ashoka]] condemned).
