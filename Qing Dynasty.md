## Introduction
The Qing were a dynasty of [[China]] formed by the [[Manchu]]. It was the last imperial dynasty of China, seen as having missed certain opportunities as an early modern Empire. It is seen as having unbounded, universal mandate while, of course, being a bounded polity.

## High Qing Period

### Yongzheng 1723-35
Largely consolodated the bureaucracy. Integrated [[Qinghai]] in the third Zunghar war.
### Qianlong 1736-95
[[Qianlong Emperor]]

## 1830
Yusuf Khova of the [[Khoqand]] Khanate opposes the Qing in Xinjiang, eventually withdrawing. Khoqand's demands, however, are accepted by the Qing in 1832, a prelude to the [[Century of Humiliation]] and [[Unequal Treaties]]. The Qing made Xinjiang a tax-free area after demanded by the Khoqandis.
