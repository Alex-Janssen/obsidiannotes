2: A sentimental, altruistic tie to help those one is connected to.
3: A sentimental tie with particular expectations and implications and embedded resources, like kin ties.
4: A tie with varying forms but with reciprocity, face, and favouritism paramount.
5: An informal, obligitory social contract, with predictable outcomes and behaviors from unpredictable origins, with care, trust, and altruism irrelevant. Highly prevelant among the rich.
