## Thoughts
A political revolution in the classical sense, unlike reform, seeks to implement a new, quasi-utopian society immediately. I argue that a revolution is inherently backward facing and crystalized, a reactionary movement that seeks to preserve whatever zeal happened in that moment. Whereas reformism is necessarily entwined with gradualism and the need to take a longer view, revolution is characterized by its impatience for success. This can lead to great or poor consequences.
I would not characterize [[Deng Xiaoping]] as a revolutionary. While his rule saw great change in China, he did so by working within the Communist system given to him. This is opposed to characters such as [[Jiang Qing]] who wished to see [[Maoism]] continued, and tried to do so by a practical coup d'etat. Reading about the [[Chinese Civil War]] and emergence of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] as paramount in the country has decreased my faith in revolution, as would anyone who sees how many still defend the [[Cultural Revolution]] and [[Great Leap Forward]].
