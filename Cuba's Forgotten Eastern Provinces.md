# Cuba's Forgotten Eastern Provinces

## Executive Summary
Through the sugar economy, Eastern [[Cuba]] aristocracy thrived in the 19th and 20th centuries while the peasantry suffered. However, even at this time, [[Havana]] was still the center of wealth. The [[Cuban Revolution]] refocused on healthcare and education in the East, hoping to equitably distribute resources and leading to more prosperity for [[Santiago de Cuba]] and [[Holguin]]. Recently, due to the [[Fall of the Soviet Union]], decline of sugar, Havana has once again become the primate city. Once again, citizens of the Oriente look toward Havana for opportunity. 

### Introduction
The Revolution was focused on the elimination of inequalities between regions and classes. Amidst Cuban economic troubles, as in the [[Special Period (Cuba)]], these inequalities have reasserted themselves and threaten the stability of the regime. Oriente benefits less from [[Remittances]] and [[Tourism in Cuba]] than the comparatively prosperous west. [[Afro-Cuban Culture]] is particularly pronounced in the east, but the region has evaded careful consideration from outside scholars: the five-hundred mile journey difficult due to poor infrastructure. Havana is Cuba's Paris or Buenos Aires, but Holguin and Santiago are the two next largest cities in the country. 
Eastern Cuba was crucial in the country's history, with Santiago the first capital, and Eastern Cuba seeing early [[Slavery in Cuba|slave]] rebellions. The Castro's launched the Cuban Revolution from the Southeastern shores from the Granma. [[Santeria]] is most prevalent in the East.

### Revolutionary Justice
[[Fidel Castro]] declared that Guantanamo was "third world in a third world country." In fact, Santiago had its share of wealth, but the revolution declared that Oriente was underdeveloped. Factories dotted the once-countryside and Santiago and Holguin both exploded in population. Social services were heavily invested in, leading to a real increase in the quality of life of Cubans, and now Eastern Cuba performs very similarly to the national average in many indices. Granma and Guantanamo perform less well, and the region has a comparative lack of potable water.

### Reversal of Fortune
Industry collapsed due to the Fall of the USSR leading to resource shortages. Sugar production is one-fifth of 1989 levels. Tourism, remittances, and small-businesses are concentrated in Havana or the West. Santiago has about 1,000 hotel beds: Havana 10,000. Over 50% of government investment went to Havana: eastern investment declined from 23% to 15% between 2010-2017. Only 12% of Santiago's investment is in industry, the majority goes to construction. 90% of Santiago province's investment goes to the urban municipality. 

### Signs of Decline
The government safety net leads to practically no starvation or extreme poverty. However, there are still many areas in Oriente with poor neighborhoods and, over a decade, 5% of citizens will leave the region, coupled with higher fertility rates than the national average. State sector wages are far below those of Havana. Labor force participation is lower, Santiago being the highest at 63% in 2017.

### Opportunities for Recovery and Growth, Stalled Economic Reforms
Agriculture, renewable energy, and tourism are among the avenues for future growth open for Oriente. Even the US military base at [[Guantanamo Bay]], if relations are normalized, could become an asset. However, foreign investors are discouraged by bureaucracy and hostile ministers. [[Raul Castro]] backtracked on promised economic reform, reimposing some price controls and halting expansion of private businesses. Oriente was the hearth of revolution, and surveillance is reportedly tighter there than the rest of Cuba.
