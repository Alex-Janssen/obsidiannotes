# Criticize Lin, Criticize Confucius
## Events
The Criticize [[Lin Biao|Lin]], Criticize [[Confucianism|Confucius]] campaign occurred at the tail end of the [[Cultural Revolution]]. [[Mao Zedong]] originated the campaign after Lin Biao was said to have plotted a coup against him. Lin Biao was said to be an admirer of Confucius. This was a convenient angle, as a relatively reformist [[Zhou Enlai]] was also seen as pro-Confucius, and thus the campaign was used by [[Jiang Qing]] as a vehicle to usurp his control. Zhou Enlai survived politically and even was allowed to chair some meetings in which he was criticized, and after August 1974 [[Mao Zedong]] said Jiang Qing went too far. This additional power struggle harmed the Chinese economy of the time and harmed academic reform. Zhou Enlai even used the slogan in 1975 as a key goal for the country. [[Deng Xiaoping]] hardly ever used this line, something used by Mao Yuanxin to undermine him, building the case that Deng Xiaoping would try to erase the revolution after Mao's death.
