## Founding and Northern Song Dynasty
The Song Dynasty was founded in the wake of the [[Five Kingdoms Period]] in 960 CE, coexisting with a Northern [[Manchu]] Liao Dynasty.  The Northern Song dynasty was founded by a former general of the [[Zhou Dynasty]], Emperor Taizu, who lead a coup d'etat.  However, the dynasty was also founded on a mutual recognition with the [[Khitan]], and the Song Dynasty recognized their qaghan as equal to the Chinese emperor.  Song Taizong, after winning a major battle against the Khitan [[Liao Dynasty]], but was defeated in the process.  The Liao later almost took the imperial capital, but war was mutually disadvantageous and a relatively equal settlement was found.  Their Northwestern Xia vassal rebelled succesfully in 1038 in a bloody war as well, a major loss of face.  This Northern Song Dynasty was largely famous for art and the founding of art academies.  Emperor Taizu encouraged former generals to appreciate drama, which was at the fringe of society at the time, in order to gain military control.  The dynasty lasted until [[Song Huizong]], who was a very talented artist but was less talented in ruling the country and who appointed cruel ministers, leading to revolts seen in [[Water Margin]].  Huizong created an art academy which helped preserve traditional Chinese painting styles.  Eventually, Manchu horsemen captured the palace and Huizong as a captive for a decade, leading to the collapse of the Northern Song and left a Southern Song rump state.
