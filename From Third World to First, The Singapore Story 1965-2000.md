# From Third World to First, The Singapore Story 1965-2000

### Foreword ([[Henry Kissinger]])
In the globalization of world politics and affairs, the West has tended to assume that greater homogenization is inevitable. Independent institutions gradually evolved in Western democracy, whereas in the wake [[Decolonization]] institutions were conceived and expected to perform immediately. Opposition in post-colonial states is often considered treason against the state instead of discontent against a government, especially if the existence of the state itself is a political statement. [[Malaysia]] rejected [[Singapore]] due to its high [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese population]] leading to integration being a difficult prospect: it was forced to come up with institutions in the wake of unwanted independence. Malaya and [[Indonesia]] seemed to be substantially more influential, and without a capable leader like [[Lee Kuan Yew]], could have easily become a poor satellite state. Instead, it is easily the most important city in Southeast Asia. A major thesis of the book is to allow institutions to form organically from post-colonial states, instead of imposing Western modes of thought on developing economies.

### Preface ([[Lee Kuan Yew]])
The book exists to teach young Singaporeans the difficulty of creating the state's prosperity. Progress, order, and security are guaranteed by the efforts of democracy and citizens; they are not the natural order of things. Lee emerged as an ardent anti-colonialist, and as PM of Singapore led it to integration with Malaya along with the Communist Party, which was stopped by the reactions to the 1964 Race Riots. The trauma of these riots led to a commitment to an integrated, diverse Singapore. His tenure saw GDP per capita rise from $400 in 1959 to $12,200 in 1990. Singapore pragmatically aligned itself with the West in the [[Cold War]], creating regional solidarity with its neighbors, despite uncertainty to the eventual winner.

## Getting the Basics Right
### Going it Alone
In 1959, Lee was Prime Minister of an autonomous state of Singapore. On August 9, 1965, it was made an independent nation. It was expelled from Malaya with no guidance or aid. Singapore was a trading post from the British, and had no independent means of survival or resources to lean on. Lee feared collapse, much like the foreign press, and did not speak them in order to not demoralize his people. At the time, British bases were likely to disappear and the [[United States]] was caught in the [[Vietnam War]]. [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] were not suitable guarantors either. America was a more forceful power than Britain, and was ascending during a British decline. Meanwhile, anti-Chinese racists threatened him and his family, and anti-Lee hate from Malay sources meant that personal security was a major concern. [[Gurkha]] [[Nepal|Nepali]] policemen were use to avoid racializing: Chinese-Malay violence needed to be avoided. A first priority was [[UN]] recognition of independence. Sinnathamby Rajaratnam was made foreign minister as a moderate but committed anti-colonialist. Defence was a priority, many Malaysians believe that Singapore should have been integrated into Malaysia by force instead of expelled. The Ministry of Interior and Defence combined police and military forces and integrated their training to get a competent force running quickly. The economy was also a major consideration: Malaysia and Indonesia did not want to use Singapore, an independent country, as a middleman. Unemployment was at 14%. [[Hong Kong]] was most similar, but was still owned by the [[United Kingdom]] and had China as a major backer: it was China's gateway to the world, not a feasible model for Singapore.
Singapore's resource was its people. Despite racial tension and lack of confidence by communists, Singapore's leaders were unquestionably committed to independence. Singapore needed this confidence, and thus needed robust anti-corruption to leverage its advantages, namely its world-class position as a harbor. Singapore also needed to have its people work together, that meant encouraging diversity of religion, language, and spreading hardship equally. Failure would have meant full absorption into Malaysia without even autonomy: not an acceptable result. During these early days, specifically the 30th of September, a coup in Indonesia by communists lead to instability, with [[Suharto]] putting it down. The region, and Singapore's future, were in uncertain territory.
### Building an Army from Scratch
The Malaysian army escorted Lee to parliament on its opening, a sign that Malaysia still had effective control over Singapore. Due to 80% of army recruits being Malays, recruitment was told to stop, which was miscommunicated as firing all Malays, which caused rioting. The Singaporean police and army was mostly Malay, and thus Chinese-Malay tension was unacceptable. Lee compromised, punishing some ringleaders but allowing all citizens to report back the next day: this diffused tension. Britain did not offer to support Singapore in building an army, which they did do for Malaysia. Lee approached  [[India]] and [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] of [[Egypt]] for support in building a military, however all did not directly support Singapore, especially disappointing was Nasser, a good friend of Lee's, dismissal. [[Israel]] did help, but this involvement was kept secret to avoid tension with Muslim Malays. Malay populations were more disposed to martial careers, but their loyalty in a perceived Chinese state was questionable. Singapore wished to have a robust armed forces, but to do this it needed to overcome a traditional Chinese dismissal of soldiering. Cadet corps were put in schools to make them seem like options for their children instead of former tools of colonial control. Parades were organized to showcase the diversity of both the servants and the forms of service, including fire brigades. Keng Swee wished for a large standing professional army, Lee wanted a small standing army with the potential of drafting the entire civilian population due to lower cost. Malaysia was unlikely to attack while the British had a troop presence in Singapore, and thus was not an immediate threat. Lee wished to see women drafted as well, but this was rejected due to cost. Recruits were given a full, public send-off to glamorize the traditionally unwanted profession. Indonesian president [[Suharto]] wished to see Indonesian citizens forgiven of the death penalty for the killing of Singaporean citizens, but, fearing that acquiescing would show Singapore as weak, especially while the British were still present in the country, Lee instead prepared for the potential security ramifications of an enraged [[Indonesia]]. In response, the Singaporean embassy, like the British embassy before, was ransacked by a [[Jakarta]] mob. Trade was paused as the Indonesian pressed speculated Chinese interference in Singaporean affairs. In more race riots, Lee made it clear that the Chinese were not pardoned for bad deeds as well, convicting 18 Malays and 18 Chinese. In army celebrations, Singapore showed off tanks when Malaysia had none, shocking [[Johor]]. By 1971, Singapore's army was in a competent state, and had the infrastructure for further expansion. Israeli military doctrine was competent but opposed to British, with less focus on discipline and more on autonomy. Still, in order to assuage tensions with Malaysia, Singapore refused to recognize Israel. In May 1969, they acquiesced and allowed for an embassy, especially after the [[Six-Day War]]. National Service remains an integral Singaporean institution, with boundaries of race, religion, and class replaced with a pure meritocracy, at least ideally. The Singaporean Armed Forces gave scholarships to particularly able students to study in Oxford or Harvard business school in exchange for some service, allowing SAF to enjoy brilliant minds. However, beyond this starting ground, the technology to develop new defence systems and the economy to produce them were necessary for Singapore's continued existence. Defence was crucial for safety in peace time: Malaysia routinely threatened to cut off Singapore's water supply.
