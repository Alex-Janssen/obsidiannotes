# Asian Education
## Guiding Questions
How did education in Asia develop?
How did it incorporate Western influences and, in turn, influence the West?
To what extent does traditional education influence modern education?

## China
Scholars were a main target in the Cultural Revolution and the [[Anti-Rightist Campaign]] (due to the Hundred Flowers Movement).  Maoism saw studies as antithetical to the working class, even as he saw Tsinghua University as a model institution.  [[Deng Xiaoping]], meanwhile, attached high importance to the resuming of exams, meritocratic entrence to universities, and raising of standards (predictable, seeing that he studied abroad in France and the USSR).  He was told that universities in China often had standards of that of Western public schools.  His attempted reforms of Tsinghua University lead to his third downfall and replacement by [[Hua Guofeng]].  When Deng gained more power, he reestablished the [[Gaokao]] and removed the propaganda teams placed in the aftermath of the [[Cultural Revolution]] and its anti-elite movement.

## Vietnam
In [[Dai Viet]], Chinese [[Confucianism|Confucian]]-style education had a major influence.  Leaders introduced civil service examinations and Confucian schools.  This was to encourage a meritocracy for the ruling class, where those who were most talented were able to assist the rulers, and this system was reinstated after Gia Long's victory in the civil war in Minh Mang's Conficucian restoration of the government.

## Annectdotal
HKUST was not a good university. Highly modeled off of the US education system, there was substantially less expectation for theoretic computer science knowledge and workload. Instead, students felt high pressure to perform well in the bell curve, employing poor studying strategies to do so. Whatever the system in [[Hong Kong]] is, it produced high-stress for relatively low results: high [[Diminishing Marginal Returns]] in my opinion.
