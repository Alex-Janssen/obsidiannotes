# Boundless Winds of Empire, Rhetoric and Ritual in Early Joseon Diplomacy with Ming China

## Introduction
[[Joseon Korea]] saw [[Ming Dynasty]] rule as boundless and universal. Joseon Korea was the size of most European monarchies: the Ming Dynasty was comparitively giant in every scale imaginable. The Korean peace with Ming for 200 years was exceptional, one seen as Korean submission but hides active Korean work to ensure its wellbeing. China saw itself as the source of civlization, with Korea a barbarian within the system that could turn hostile. He rejected Korean investiture which secured Korea as an alien, non-civilized entity external to the Ming state (counter to the idea of the [[Tributary System]], which would see Ming as a universal power). Korea simultaneously viewed imperial rule as extending over the barbarian "yi," but viewed themselves as racially purer than Japanese, [[Manchu]], and [[Mongols]]. Korea used a term 小中花 which implied the country as another soruce of civilization rather than another China. Tianxia was similarly vague. Mongols saw themselves as a universal civilization, with many religions flourishing in the [[Yuan Dynasty]] and translators moving back and forth. 
Kwon Kun's poem did not succeed in granting investure (another unsuccessful poet, sounds like the strategy didn't work). Historians have balked at Fairbank's tributary model, but scholars of international relations have found it a useful tool. Korea was the ideal example of this system. The [[Imjin War]] is both an example of the tributary system working and a turning point in relations. A reason why Korea is a model tributary is that Korea tried to present itself as part of the Chinese world, with tools such as poetry to this effect. The tribute system as a model forces us to see ritual and rhetoric as effects from this system rather than active attempts to change Korea's status. To understand the system, we need to examine its inner workings.
Ming had interests in Korea, but unlike the Yuan did not seek to conquer it. Korea was more important as an example of its empire rather than the land itself. The term empire is of European origin, with no traditional Asian equivalent. This and sovreignty were used in [[Japanese Historiography]] to justify its annexation of Korea, even though the history examined would not have lent itself to a traditional idea of "sovreignty." Empire is instead defined as an unwillingness to bound its expanse and power, something as familiar to the Ming Dynasty as the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. 統 implies coerscion and control, temporal in nature and is a more apt word for the Ming dynasty's brand of imperialism. Beyond traditional tools of war and diplomacy, Ming used ritual, calendars, and music among other tools to strengthen legitimacy to the [[Sage Kings]], the basis of Ming's [[Mandate of Heaven]]. The Sinitic language tradition was strong enough to be a commonality in this SInitic imperial tradition, with the [[Liao Dynasty]], [[Dali Kingdom]] among others laying claim to this tradition despite not being [[Han Chinese]]. 
Korea's goal was to ward off direct conflict with the Ming. To maintain autonomy, it had to be recognized as already part of this Sinitic "Empire." (Like Vietnam, Hua culture = freedom, barbarity = war and death of regime). Two main schools of thought prevail, a colonial tale of resistence and a Whig ideal of the benevolence of Ming rule, both of which strip borderland agency. Agency is found in the borders, liminal zones, with empire being a negotiation between the center and the periphery. Envoys are the focus of the book. Korea engaged in authoethnography, describing itself in Sinitic terms for the virtue of its overlord. Joseon participated in the construction of the Ming's empire actively. 

## The Envoy’s Virtue
A Ming envoy insulted Joseon cuisine and offered to share a Chinese recipe while sexually harrassing a courtesan. The king refused to admonish the envoy, saying all they could do was bid them farewell. Homosocial masculinity was meant to be performed rather than heterosexual ideals. Restraint was idealized and venerated, building the idea of the Ming as a fountainhead of morality. Improper envoys were castigated by other envoys, but argued that Joseon's acceptance meant that improper behavior was acceptable. Sexual restraint was a paragon of integrity. Music by women could corrupt an envoy, which was ignored by virtue (music being heavily tied to [[Confucianism]]). (This reminds me of [[Water Margin]], with female presence corrupting pure masculine brotherhood). Joseon may have used female performers to test the virtue of envoys. Reception of gifts was another tell of morality. An envoy demanded bribes in exchange for the Ming response to the [[Imjin War]] in 1609. An emissary, Tang, was resolute in not accepting gifts and showed appreciation to the Korean court. Literary talent and virtue filled similar roles in the construction of the envoy's social status. An envoy, Gao, ostentatiously wrote poems extolling his own virtue while being greedy, which infuriated the Joseon court. Brilliant Flowers was an anthology of court poetry, and Gao's poem thanking the court for gifts exposed that he had not taken nothing from Korea, a direct blow to his reputation. Chinese envoys thought Joseon constructed "refusing gold pavilions" for virtuous envoys, which they did not. Despite their non-existence, the myth shows the power of these envoy reputations in the Ming court. [[Qing Dynasty]] diplomats were instructed to act in accordance with Ming virtue, a constructed sense of benevolence. Korea, despite this, continued to present gifts it expected it would decline and always recorded envoys favorably. Korea actively participated in the construction of the moral ideal.

## Conclusion
Joseon diplomacy was centered around preemptively controlling empire as a system which involved external stakeholders. Korea appropriated and redirected empire. The [[Imjin War]] was a sign of the preservation of the Ming imperial system. Many Ming thinkers thought of the Imjin war as a battle between barbarians. Minister of war Shi Xing helped convince the court that Korea was in the inner circle and thus warranted defence. Joseon offered integration into Ming at some point, and convinced Ming that defence of tributaries was part of Ming's obligation. Rhetoric alone, casting Korea as a guardian of empire, did not save Joseon, but it did play a role. Joseon was constantly afraid of abandonment or annexation, especially with [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] proposing to occupy Southern Korea. Ming's intervention increased Chinese knowledge of Korea, diminishing exoticism. Ming took more active interest in internal affairs, i.e. succession and military preperation, overthrowing a king for being insufficiently loyal. Imperial rule, previously a tool of rhetoric, was close to being a reality. This never came to fruition due to the [[Ming-Qing Transition]], with Korea's Ming loyalty likely weaker than believed in China. Jurchen to [[Manchu]] [[Hong Taiji]] invaded Joseon in 1637, forcing the king to prostrate himself for the first time since the [[Koryo Dynasty]] but did not annex the defeated Joseon. Perhaps the Korean submission was more valuable than annexation, especialy during the conflict with the Ming taking center stage. The Qing were obsessed with markers of legitimacy, taking new calendars and reign titles: Korean submission was part of what empire meant. Korea survived the [[Yuan Dynasty]] by being the first to submit to [[Kublai Khan]].
Korean self-identification served the joint purpose of belonging to civilization with independence. Korean rhetoric was like a quantum superposition, submission depending on observation. The Joseon did not internally accept Qing legitimacy but kept up pretenses, a furthering of this STEM metaphor. The Late 19th century saw a formalization of diplomatic ties, and Western ties and the [[Sino-Japanese War (1894)]] loosened Korea's predicament. The idea of empire has lead to the ideas of the [[Tributary System]], regional system, East Asian ritual world, among others. Individual cases to observe the language game is more illustrative than giving it a name. Joseon was experimental in using ritual to create a different ordering of empire. The idea of a China-led order is still prevalent, with echos to modern politics of China's rise. Curating myth is one of the few avenues of power for middle powers such as Korea. Korean elites were included as key stakeholders in the construction of Chinese empire.
