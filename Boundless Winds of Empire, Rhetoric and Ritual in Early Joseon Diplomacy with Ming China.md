# Boundless Winds of Empire, Rhetoric and Ritual in Early Joseon Diplomacy with Ming China

## Introduction
[[Joseon Korea]] saw [[Ming Dynasty]] rule as boundless and universal. Joseon Korea was the size of most European monarchies: the Ming Dynasty was comparitively giant in every scale imaginable. The Korean peace with Ming for 200 years was exceptional, one seen as Korean submission but hides active Korean work to ensure its wellbeing. China saw itself as the source of civlization, with Korea a barbarian within the system that could turn hostile. He rejected Korean investiture which secured Korea as an alien, non-civilized entity external to the Ming state (counter to the idea of the [[Tributary System]], which would see Ming as a universal power). Korea simultaneously viewed imperial rule as extending over the barbarian "yi," but viewed themselves as racially purer than Japanese, [[Manchu]], and [[Mongols]]. Korea used a term 小中花 which implied the country as another soruce of civilization rather than another China. Tianxia was similarly vague. Mongols saw themselves as a universal civilization, with many religions flourishing in the [[Yuan Dynasty]] and translators moving back and forth. 
Kwon Kun's poem did not succeed in granting investure (another unsuccessful poet, sounds like the strategy didn't work). Historians have balked at Fairbank's tributary model, but scholars of international relations have found it a useful tool. Korea was the ideal example of this system. The [[Imjin War]] is both an example of the tributary system working and a turning point in relations. A reason why Korea is a model tributary is that Korea tried to present itself as part of the Chinese world, with tools such as poetry to this effect. The tribute system as a model forces us to see ritual and rhetoric as effects from this system rather than active attempts to change Korea's status. To understand the system, we need to examine its inner workings.
Ming had interests in Korea, but unlike the Yuan did not seek to conquer it. Korea was more important as an example of its empire rather than the land itself. The term empire is of European origin, with no traditional Asian equivalent. This and sovreignty were used in [[Japanese Historiography]] to justify its annexation of Korea, even though the history examined would not have lent itself to a traditional idea of "sovreignty." Empire is instead defined as an unwillingness to bound its expanse and power, something as familiar to the Ming Dynasty as the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. 統 implies coerscion and control, temporal in nature and is a more apt word for the Ming dynasty's brand of imperialism. Beyond traditional tools of war and diplomacy, Ming used ritual, calendars, and music among other tools to strengthen legitimacy to the [[Sage Kings]], the basis of Ming's [[Mandate of Heaven]]. The Sinitic language tradition was strong enough to be a commonality in this SInitic imperial tradition, with the [[Liao Dynasty]], [[Dali Kingdom]] among others laying claim to this tradition despite not being [[Han Chinese]]. 
Korea's goal was to ward off direct conflict with the Ming. To maintain autonomy, it had to be recognized as already part of this Sinitic "Empire." (Like Vietnam, Hua culture = freedom, barbarity = war and death of regime). Two main schools of thought prevail, a colonial tale of resistence and a Whig ideal of the benevolence of Ming rule, both of which strip borderland agency. Agency is found in the borders, liminal zones, with empire being a negotiation between the center and the periphery. Envoys are the focus of the book. Korea engaged in authoethnography, describing itself in Sinitic terms for the virtue of its overlord. Joseon participated in the construction of the Ming's empire actively.
