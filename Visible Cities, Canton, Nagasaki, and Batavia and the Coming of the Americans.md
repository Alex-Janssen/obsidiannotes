# Visible Cities, Canton, Nagasaki, and Batavia and the Coming of the Americans
## Three Windows of Opportunity
World travel has transformed from something that is impossible to all, even kings, to a consumer good. The book focuses on Batavia ([[Jakarta]]), [[Nagasaki]], and Canton ([[Guangzhou]]), cities which were historically distant to the European traveller. These cities are highly visible and so record [[Japan]] and [[China]] in their shared conflict over control over the [[South China Sea]]. The [[East India Company]] also used these ports frequently and kept exceptional records. The changes that affected the Early Modern world hit these ports too: they are windows into modernization. Despite the overestimation of the [[Tributary System]], Chinese dynastic instability rocked the world of Maritime Asia. 
Chinese traders were banned by the [[Ming Dynasty]] in 1405 to curb private trade and encourage economic control, but this lead to illegal trading by [[Fujian]] merchants pretending to be foreign tribute voyages. The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] based themselves in Nagasaki and [[Macau]]. The Portuguese had an effective monopoly over Japanese trade, and in response Japan opened settlements on [[Taiwan]], [[Manila]], [[Hoi An]], and [[Ayutthaya]]. Eventually, in 1639, the Dutch replaced the expelled Portuguese in Japanese trade. The Dutch failed to gain entry into the Chinese market, adopting the Japanese strategy of interacting with foreign Chinese proxies, and the VOC became a regional power. The Zheng clan took control of Chinese-Formosan trade on the Dutch behalf, with them being a major player in 1640. In the [[Establishment of the Qing Dynasty]], some members remained loyal to Ming, kicking out the Dutch and establishing a fiefdom in Formosa. In 1683, the island was captured by the Qing. In response, the Qing reopened private trade. In response to a trade freeze in 1717 that devestated Batavia, the Dutch realized the peril of overreliance on China.

## Managing Trade across Cultures
Canton is the traditional gate to China, and has the most history of the three ports. Nagasaki was foudned for [[Jesuits]] to interact with Japan. Japanese trade was more monitered than the other two ports. The VOC controlled territory and factories in friendly and unfriendly territory, adapting to local customs.
Batavia had a large local Chinese presence intermixed with a European shell. Batavia was a diplomatic center, taking part in letter writing rituals to leaders (sounds like Chinese tributary relations). After a pogrom, the Chinese community was given more self-government and seperation. Every year, a third of the city died of some tropical illness (!!!!!!!!). Fish ponds may have lead to highly prevelant [[Malaria]]. 
Nagasaki was the only city where Christianity was preached in Japan. Chinese visitors gave news that was often passed to Japan, a hub of current affairs occasionally altered by the [[Netherlands]]. 
Canton may have had the highest port fees in the world. Despite competition in the mid 1700s, foreign merchants talked amongst each other. Canton's trade was dominated by [[Tea]], with payments mostly being in silver (see [[Cambridge World History, VI, The Construction of a Global World#Silver in a Global Context]]). 
The Qing placed a time limit on time spendable abroad, exiling those who exceeded it in 1727. In 1754, Batavia was largely bypassed for trade in favor of direct routes to tea.
[[United States]] traders came in due to the closing of [[West Indies]] trade to Americans. Americans were the most prevalent [[Opium]] traders in China. Americans were thought to be future competitors of the Dutch, but, during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], America bailed out the Netherlands in their Far-Eastern holdings.
The burgeoning Canton trade, in 1790, may have been the last Qing triumph, with pirates and smugglers cutting into their gains. The [[United Kingdom]] would take over [[India]] and plan the [[Opium War]].

## Bridging the Divide
Port cities have declined, with ports moving away from city centers and being less embedded in city life. Prostitution was rampant. Qing visitors to Batavia felt a sense of superiority, with Sunday leading to no work, a lack of poetry, and other complaints. There was more interest in Western items than people in the little literature that survives from China. Japanese curiosity about the Dutch partially led to the [[Meiji Revolution]]. Some Dutch had respect and curiosity about Japanese culture. The Dutch aided the [[American Revolution]] via trade in the Carribbean, leading to an Anglo-Dutch war in 1780. [[John Quincy Adams]] saw the kowtow ritual, not opium, as the cause of the Opium War. Far-East trade was persistent, and with the rising Canton and falling Batavia, America replaced Europe in the 1790s. Many students of mainland SEA state that 1750-80 was the last time Asia was autonomus, but maritime SEA was always a borderland. Later, [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Shanghai]] among others emerged as new ports.
