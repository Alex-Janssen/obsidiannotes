# Banaras, City of Light
## City of Shiva
### The Lord of Kashi
[[Shiva]] chose [[Varanasi]] (earlier Kashi) as his homeplace after leaving meditation in the [[Himalayas]], turning from an ascetic to a city dweller. There are thousands of Shiva temples in Varanasi, and, while a holy site before the trend of Shiva worship, is significantly embedded in it. Legend said that Shiva had to evict a king and inhabitants to live there, so an attendant made a statue of [[Ganesha]] which was destroyed by an angry and jealous king, cursing the city. The sanctity does not come from Shiva being there; it attracted Shiva after all, and thus is inherently holy.
### Shiva the Outsider
Shiva is often called the "great lord" and is seen as transcending human ideas about divinity, with many faces, arms, and weapons. He is a yogi on the fringes of culture. While present in the [[Rg Veda]] and other vedic texts, he was a minor god. There is evidence of worship of a very similar earlier deity to Shiva. Shiva has less concern of [[Dharma]] than other gods, not caring about purity or pollution. When among society, he lives in the cremation ground, with no family, lineage, or worldly connection. Despite this, he is called auspicious, gentle even. In early texts, he is considered both a blessed and terrible figure, embodying duality. Some hymnists would some time ask him to be present and then soon after to leave. Paravati marries Shiva despite difficulty and recommendations to marry [[Vishnu]], as Shiva was seen as repulsive, but she responds that Shiva was a brahman transcending worldly ideas of goodness and wealth. In Hinduism, there are two types of sacred things: auspicious is inherently goods, while holy transcends or challenges these ideas. Shiva challenges binaries of good and bad, auspicious and evil. Shiva was the only god not invited to the great sacrifice due to his own conceptions of duality, he was beyond caste and gender (if Shiva is portrayed as male, but Shakti means he has half female energy, why is he used?).
### The Many Faced and Faceless Shiva
Shiva is often represented with five faces or gestures representing different moments of creation, preservation, destruction, concealment, and revelation. He is creative both in music and by being essentially erotic. He is often portrayed as beautiful, with his children [[Ganesha]] and [[Skanda]]. Shiva preserves in order to uphold balance in the universe. Even for Shiva, the world must not only be transcended but actively supported. Shiva's destruction is aided by his yoga practice, as yoga is trying to return to the origin of creation, thus becoming a horrible dweller of cremation grounds. Shiva is uniquely unknowable, able to both reveal momentarily and re-conceal himself. Finally, the supreme face, Shiva bestows grace and mercy upon believers. Even in other actions grace is shown.
### The Linga of Shiva
Anthropomorphic images of Shiva are present in Varanasi but are uncommonly the center of worship. Instead, linga, an abstract statue representation, is more commonly worshipped in their place, both a phallus and emblem. While it is sexual in nature, this can be overexaggerated too, and contains both male and female elements. The linga is, in some sense, a unique symbol of wholeness in the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] universe. Shiva represents a fixed point in the whirlpool of [[Samsara]]. Shiva can be seen metaphorically like the moon, with phases but also parts unseen. In a linga, everything in creation is at rest.
### The Linga of Light
The Linga of Light is an often-used puranic legend to explain the origin of linga worship on earth. Shiva is often seen as part of this linga, instead of it being the result of his castration. [[Brahma]] and [[Vishnu]] were arguing over who was supreme, while Vedas support that Shiva is. At this point, a column of fire pierces the heavens, and Shiva reveals himself as the originator. Vishnu accepts this defeat, but Brahma does not, treating him either as a youth or lying that he reached the top. Shiva cuts off one of Brahma's five heads, leaving him with the traditionally depicted four. This act of killing a brahman is so terrible that Shiva's avatar has to travel all over India with the skull stuck, until it comes loose in Varanasi. This is a mythical representation of the ending of Brahma worship and Vishnu's preservation in the cannon. Shiva's visiting of the tirthas and Varanasi forgives him of this horrible sin. The pillar of fire can be seen as a linga, an embodiment of the one, transcending Shiva himself. Lingas create tirthas as they are definitionally crossing places, devotion only prescribed to Shiva. Multiple lingas claim to be the linga of light.
### The Lingas of Varanasi
It is said that there is not a place the size of a sesame seed in Varanasi without a linga; possibly 100,000 exist in the city. There are portable and immovable lingas. Despite the countless number of lingas, Shiva is said to be fully present in each. The remainder of the text will focus on three particular lingas, Omkara, Vishvanatha, and Kedara as the anchor the North, Center, and South of the city respectively and have vastly different histories, providing a holistic view of worship in Varansi.
## Omkara
Omkara used to be one of the most important Lingas in the entire city 1000 years ago, but has mostly faded from public view. Omkara is present in a little hill, but is just simply not well known by the population, in a Muslim neighborhood not often visited by the Hindu pilgrims or residents. This Muslim presence in the city is the main cause of its newfound irrelevance, with a poor, small Hindu population unable to pay for its maintenance. The old temple was likely impressive, but now only a small, rarely visited shrine exists. There still exists pilgrims that visit, showing some local enthusiasm for a revival of the temple's former glory.
Om is said to consist of five sounds, and thus Omkara has five shrines, one for each sound, however most of the temples have dissipated over time.
In legend, lord Brahma preformed ritual here, when Shiva emerged from a pillar illuminating the four directions, the sound om was emitted, and Shiva made Brahma creator of the world. Shiva, like Om and the temple, has five parts (humans are said to have five, progressively holier sheaths), but also embodies the supremacy of the One, Brahman. The general idea is four parts with a transcending fifth, like the four directions with above.
Varansi was surrounded by a river which, in certain years, would run backward, making the city like an island, an auspicious time as it would be surrounded by the [[Ganges]] despite hardships. The area of Omkara was treated most harshly under Muslim rule, and although certain temples still stand and are well maintained it has never regained its status as the spiritual heart.
## Vishvanatha
Vishvanatha (lit. lord of all) has been the preeminent Shiva linga in Varanasi (one of the most in India) for over 1000 years despite  the temple being relatively architecturally plain. The current temple is only from the eighteenth century, earlier temples were destroyed and rebuilt constantly. Razia and [[Aurangzeb]] built mosques atop old sites of this temple. Only Hindus are allowed to enter the temple. The worship inside the temple is striking, with sounds and sights being seen as a sign of sanctity, unlike silence in other traditions. The place is special due to the devotion brought over centuries for a common cause. There is a saying that pilgrims make the tirtha, and thus a substantial part of the holiness is the worship itself.
There is a holy well where pilgrims drink before and after their journeys, as it was said to be dug by Shiva and this well had the first pure waters in the universe, giving the drinker wisdom. The temple of Aurangzeb is near, with a part of the wall being the remains of the old Hindu temple. In 1809, Hindus tried to create a small shrine in the neutral area, provoking giant religious conflict. The Hindus came out with a superior position and a shrine was eventually put there.
Vishvanatha usurped another, previously superior linga in Gupta times and which now only takes up a small corner of the temple. Historically, there were two temples, a famous puranic temple and Vishveshvara which was local. After being razed, it moved close and usurped the other, Avimukteshwar.
Avimukteshvara was considered the reigning deity of Varanasi (Kashi) in a 6th century text. It was said that a linga was being carried by goblins, which was dropped in fear in the modern area, literally a blessing from the sky.
The temples were considered separate in the 1600, wish Vishveshvara being a popular temple on a high hill. Even in the 12th century it was considered important, with it being targeted for destruction. Of the original temple, Razia's Mosque now stands. It was rebuilt and lively again but in the 14th and 15th centuries mass temple destruction happened. It was considered to still have a special dharma even with a potential lack of linga, and was rebuilt, especially under [[Akbar]].
