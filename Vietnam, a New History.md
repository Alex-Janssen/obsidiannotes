# Vietnam, a New History
## Introduction
[[Vietnam]] is far too often seen solely through the lense of American intervention: all throughout its history great powers have sought to control it.  China has repeatedly gained and lost control over Vietnam for control of the sea and South-East Asian trade, and France colonized Indochina for similar reasons.  During [[World War 2]], Japan, Russia, and the US sought to control Vietnam for strategic reasons.  Now, Vietnam serves as a counterweight to Chinese influence in the [[South China Sea]].  Vietnam should not be appreciated for its role with outside powers; it is not a tool or battleground for other countries, but rather a rich region in its own right.  Far from solely being a victim, Vietnam could be seen as a colonizer in its own right, with its own divisions and diversity (over 50 ethnic groups inhabit the country).  Instead of there being one Vietnam, there have been several.  Vietnam's current borders have existed for less than 90 years.  All too often is [[Asian Modernization]] seen through a colonial lense, with the [[Qing Dynasty]]'s' defeat in the [[Opium War]] seen as the beginning of China's modernization.

## Northern Configurations
In 1694, the leader of [[Dai Viet]], Ngyuen Phuc Chu, requested to officially convert himself and the court to [[Buddhism]].  This came at at time when [[Daoism]] had traditional sway and Christianity was being actively preached in the country.  
Vietnamese civilization started with the Dong Son civilization, a diverse group inhabiting much of Northern Vietnam (the Red River delta) and Southern China.  Central control was weak, although some central authority was practiced in Co Loa, near Hanoi, in the 3rd Century BC.  Traditionally, Chinese civilization was in equal measure curious and afraid of this proto-Vietnamese civilization, using similar terms to "barbarian."  Yue ("Viet") was used, a word meaning "those from beyond."   Thus, Yuenan became the enduring Chinese term for Vietnam, a term adopted by the Vietnamese.  In the second and first centuries BCE, a variety of Vietnamese and Han empires arose and fell.  Vietnam under Han rule was known as Jiaozhi.  In 231 CE, a prominant [[Han Dynasty | Han]] bureaucrat vouched for Vietnam's potential in trade.  Han overlords allowed local Vietnamese substantial control over their own governance in order to keep stability.  While this is seen as imperial conquest by the Chinese, many Vietnamese wanted success within the framework, and Vietnamese officials served in China well into the 20th century.  Thus, the capital region became very sinetic, wheras local rule was still highly variable.  This rule developed Vietnam, allowing its population to blossom to one million by the second century CE.  Chinese innovations in statecraft, language (Hanzi), technology (paper) seeped into Vietnam.  While the official philosophy of [[Confucianism]] guided much of Vietnam's Sinetic rule, [[Mahayana Buddhism]] spread into Vietnam.  Chinese control was real in a few sites, but rural areas exercised a high level of autonomy and imperial perogative rarely spread that far.  Buddhism fit comfortably into this rural fringe.  Conficianism was elite and not widespread, with many still clinging to Buddhism even when educated in Conficianism.  
However, in the 10th century, Jiaozhi gained independence from China.  The collapse of the [[Tang Dynasty]] lead to a rapid decentralization and colonial elites usurped control.  Ngo Quyen, a general in Jiaozhi, beat back an attack from a rival state, also dubbed Dai Viet (later Southern Han), and formed his own polity, confusingly later named [[Dai Viet]].  The [[Khmer Empire]] and [[Champa]] were unhappy to see their trade with China cut off by Dai Viet, and Tai polities had historically sacked Jiaozhi lands when their trade of Vietnamese salt was disrupted.  These threats, plus a possible reconquest by China, threatened Ngo's fledgling empire.  After a Civil War, Ly Thai To formed a dynasty in 1009.  These military rulers used monarchy to justify their rule, but the extent of Chinese modernization and how to legitimize dynastic rule were lingering questions for each ruler of Dai Viet.  Dai Viet rulers created mythical monarchs to justify political action.  The Chinese were somewhat like Rome to Medieval Europe, Chinese script and history was necessary to legitimize Vietnamese history.  Buddhist monks used spirituality to justify Dai Viet rule as well.  However, early Dai Viet bureaucracy was not as sophisticated as its Chinese counterpart.  The Ly and Tran dynasties both maintained military rulers out of necessity; Tang-era civil servents left during the instability.  Control was only strongly felt around Hanoi, and local leaders still had a lot of sway.  Effective rulers embraced rural traditions; Ly Thai To elevated Buddhism and sought to channel spirits to central political power.  Both Ly and Tran dynasties bolstered agriculture, increasing Dai Viet's population.  Coastal Dai Viet saw rapid increase in trade due to the prosperity of the [[Song Dynasty]], allowing Vietnamese ceramics to meet the global market.  Van Don emerged as a central port, and mass cultural intermixing occured here, and thus new ideas and immigrants spread.  Cham art, music, and [[Hinduism]] found popularity in Dai Viet, as did [[Zen Buddhism]] and an increase in printing and Confucianism.  Hanoi ruled over the inland, deeply Buddhist and spiritual Vietnam, wheras the coastal regions were increasingly cosmopolitan.  
The Tran Dynasty was from the latter group.  Their control over Hanoi melded the coastal trade and inland control, making Dai Viet much more dynamic.  Champa invaded Dai Viet multiple times, and both successfully fended off the [[Mongols]] at the Red River.  The Tran moved the center of political gravity toward the coast and more openly accepted Confucianism.
In 1406, the [[Ming Dynasty]] reimposed Chinese rule over Dai Viet, using indirect rule as before.  [[Zhang He]] was sent to intimidate foreign empires, and the Ming used tribute to expand its control.  As its 13th province, the Ming burnt Dai Viet books and was militarilly cruel.  Non-Vietnamese speaking bureaucrats took control.  In 1418, a small band lead by Le Loi rebelled against Ming, and in 1427 they successfully drove them out using modern technology.  Ming civil service influenced this new Dai Viet, as did Confucianism.  Le Loi, against Chinese colonialism, reoriented Dai Viet toward Confucianism.  He adopted Chinese notions of a civil service exam and started Confucian academies.  Le created centralized taxes and decreased private ownership.  Administrators took power from rural local leaders.
The Vietnamese also took Chinese notions of empire and East Asian superiority.  They conquered in the name of Han, not Yue, civilization.  In 1471, Le Thanh Tong successfully conquered Champa, a landmark year for Vietnamese colonialism.  Le armies took Tai land in the Northwest in 1479.  Viet populations spread through these conquered areas, and often brutally treated populations at war.
In 1511, [[Jesuits]] landed to preach Christianity, which lead to the Latin alphabet Vietnamese is written in today.  300,000 Catholics lived in the Red River Valley by the mid-eighteenth century.  Like Buddhists before, Catholics were mostly rural and poor.
Le's reforms were not permanent, with disgruntled aristocratic families and anti-colonialists posing threats to Dai Viet hegemony.  The Le were connected to Laos, and distrusted the coast and China.
In 1527, the Mac used a succession crisis to attempt to take power.  Mac Dang Dung succesfully overthrew the emperor and claimed control.  The Le were joined by other families in an attempt to take control, largely from the South.  The Mac, Thrinh, and Nguyen lead three divided Vietnams.  The Thrinh had de-facto control over the Le dynasty (like [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] with the Oda dynasty).  The Thrinh used military ritual instead of Confucian ideal to weild control.  Nguyen Hoang surrendered to the Thrinh, and Dai Viet was reunited.  
The South of Vietnam was highly populous, and more influenced by Champa, Hindu, Buddhist, and Sanskrit influences.  Europeans, Arabs, Persians, Japanese and Chinese all congregated around rich Dai Viet ports.  Nguyen Hoang built Dai Viet using these southern influences.  In the late 1600s, Nguyen Hoang fully conquered Champa.  The Nguyen, like the Le, were martial.  Ming loyalists were invited to help develop the South.  Viet peoples settled in the South slowly, incorporating it into a larger Vietnamese culture.  Naturally, cultures intermixed and new innovations were made.  The Nguyen, like the Ming, used indirect rule to placate local powers, especially the Thrinh.  In function, Dai Viet was made up not of a Thrinh hegemony over a Le emperor, but an increasing Nguyen southern Da Trong presence over a northern Da Ngoai Thrinh presence.  In 1627, a Civil War erupted between these two houses, ending in stalemate.  In 1709, the Nguyen attempted to create their own monarchy.
However, in 1771, three brothers used declining economic conditions to rebel.  Trade was decreasing and taxes were very high.  In a village called Tay Son, a rebellion against the Thrinh, Le, and Nguyen was launched.  The Tay Son quickly made peace with the Thrinh, and the Tay Son rebellion killed the Nguyen monarch in 1777.  They founded their own short lived monarchy, so that there were three Vietnamese poltities; Thrinh Hanoi, Nguyen Mekong, and Tay Son Vijaya.  In 1786, the Tay Son took over Hanoi and the Red River Delta.  Quang Trung proclaimed himself leader of the Dai Viet; the Qing invaded to reistablish Le tributary rule but Quang Trung successfully drove them out.  However, after his death, Gia Long was able to keep the Nguyen state on life support.  Gia Long exploited divisions in the Tay Son government and retook control of Dai Viet in 1801.
## A Divided House and French Imperial Meridian
Gia Long's successors kept a watchful eye on British Colonialism, especially regarding the [[Opium War]].  Emperor Minh Mang tried to reform Gia Long's military state into a Confucian civil state, integrating warring families and foreign peoples.  
Gia Long was cautious with regards to centralization after the civil war, especially compared to Thailand and Burma.  He tolerated the Champa and Buddhism, and did not seek to impose Viet culture on essentially foreign peoples.  He rejected elevating the status of Buddhism or Catholicism as well, instead seeing Chinese statecraft as a model for development.  Gia Long's Vietnam was fragile and divided.  The Nguyen sought to elevate this Southern dynasty as a natural continuation, but many, especially former Tay Son supporters, still saw the Le family and Red River Basin as the heart of Vietnam.  The Nguyen created the "Mandarin Route," a North to South road, seeking to connect the two Vietnams.
Minh Mang, meanwhile, lacked this caution born of war.  He clamped down on privileges for minorities and tried to get rid of military vestiges in the government.  He also believed that a central, taxing state could provide infrastructure and foreing imports, adopting the Thai model of government, and promoted state-sponsored trade with China and the West.  In 1819, Britain gained control of [[Singapore]], and the Dutch continued integrating Indonesia.  In the 1820s, Britain also gained control over Burma, a signal that Southeast Asia was not exempt from colonialism.  However, the most pressing threat to Minh Mang's control was, in fact, military privileges granted in the Nguyen's native South, where local generals began advocating for seperatist ideas.  Minh Mang waited for the most prominant of these generals to die before executing prominant Tay Son leaders in 1833, intimidating those who would revolt and revoking Southern autonomy, renaming the country to [[Dai Nam]].  
Minh Mang imposed ancestor warship over other religions, and sought to integrate Dai Nam with Chinese culture.  He got rid of Champa and Khmer autonomy as well, and expanded Vietnamese colonization of ethnic minorities, and in the 1830s Minh Mang conquered Cambodia, and by the 1840s it also controled some of Eastern Laos.  This was justified using Vietnam's links to China, civilizing the "barbarian" lands to its West.  After 1848, however, Thais succesfully backed a Cambodian-quasi independence, helped by Minh Mang's death in 1841.
French opposition to Vietnam's treatment of Catholocism grew.  However, the combination of agressive French-backed missions tolerated by Gia Long and Minh Mang's project to impose Confucianism lended itself to conflict.  In January 1833, Minh Mang banned Catholicism in the empire after Muslim and Buddhist revolts.  There was a Southern, Catholic backed insurrection from 1833 to 1835, which ended in resounding defeat after briefly occupying the entire South.  This coincided with the time of increased Bourbon involvement in the protection of Catholicism.
Minh Mang's successors curtailed foreign travel and trade on the heels of Western involvement in China, simliar to Japan's Sakoku policy.  Vietnam still flourished in trade and technology, especially shipbuilding.  Around 10% of Vietnam's rural population died when famine and cholera coincided in the 1840s.  Peasants sold land to pay taxes, increasing unemployment and further decreasing tax revenue.  The dynasty attempted to distribute food and construct shelters.  However, Buddhists and Catholics played a large part in helping the poor, increasing religious factionalism.  Many revolts sprung up, including those with Catholic support.
In 1858, France occupied Vietnam, using persecution of Catholicism as a pretext, even though Gia Long and the Nguyen dynasty were the most amicable to Catholicism in Vietnam's history so far.  The main reason, though was prestige and naval influence.  A French meridian was constructed, and French businessmen and merchants were among the most pro-colonial forces in the imperial court.   After the execution of two Spanish missionaries, France launched a punitive expidition in Dai Nam.
The [[Qing Dynasty]] was completely unable to assist in warding off the French threat, coinciding with the [[Taiping Rebellion]] and Opium War.  In 1862, Vietnam ceded three southeastern provinces to the French.  In 1863, the French made Cambodia a protectorate, and in 1867, the French occupied the remaining Southern lands.  The emperor's response to this was to follow China's footsteps and offer trade deals in exchange for the land.  However, independent French expiditions met Vietnamese resistance in Hanoi, with war breaking out without the consent of either official government, with Dai Nam recognizing the official loss of Cochinchina in 1874.  In 1875, the French created the Bank of Indochina, an important colonial institution administering the economy of this nascent French colony.  At this point, the French colonial project was run by liberal-minded, secular republicans who wished for prestige above all else.  In 1882, a small French force occupied Hanoi, but the Qing liberated it.  In 1883, this was reignated into a full-scale war, and the French soon occupied imperial Hue, with Tonkin (North Vietnam) ceded soon after, and in 1884 the Qing ceased recognizing Dai Nam as a tributary.  In June 1884, the Second Treaty of Hue established French control over the entirity of Dai Nam.  This occupation was incomplete, with many fringe towns not budging, especially those controlled by the Chinese.  The French  attacked many Southern Chinese ports in order for this resistance to stop, and, after French political chenanigans, Dai Nam ceased to exist as an independent state, alongside many Thai Lao tributaries.  Thailand ceded Cambodia and Laos to France, and France allowed Thailand to remain as a buffer state.  [[French Indochina]] had been born.
