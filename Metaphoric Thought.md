# Metaphoric Thought
## Guiding Questions
How is thought guided by metaphor? Is metaphor a tool of language or cognition?
Is thought embodied? Is there any form of thought that transcends biologic "hardware?"

## Thesis
In my view, the process of learning, and thought, is building models of comprehension guided under simplistic baselines that predict infinitely complex external behavior. Natural laws are strong predictors, theses weaker, and disagreements in thought are disagreements in the best ways to both understand the dynamics of a knowledge domain and the ways to use these models to inform behavior that results in desired outcomes. In the process of building these models, metaphors are a sort of cognitive bridge, letting rules be reapplied in multiple domains and simplifying the net load of cognition and knowledge creation. If thought is, itself, embodied, it is impossible for there to be universal truth: any arguments for universal truth would only appear as such to embodied thoughts and we have no way of knowing what other ways of knowing are beyond this model.
