# Mengzi
## Background
Mengzi was born after [[Confucius' Analects|Confucius]] died.  Mengzi sought to advance [[Confucianism]], especially against [[Mozi]]'s thought.  Mengzi believes that material conditions are requisite for the cultivation of the soul, but that everyone's potential to become a sage will not be realized.  Mengzi believes in learning from a wise teacher, and recognizes that the absolute best decision in any given situation may be context dependent.
## Chapter Summaries
### 1
(1A1) A state is endangered by a quest for profit.  Righteousness allows for advancement not at the expense of others.  Righteousness instills a love of stability and filial piety.  (1A3) Even if a ruler is more benevolent than others, they are still not righteous; it is binary and thus a state will fail.  (17A) A king is seen to not be virtuous but having a "sprout of compassion" when sparing a frightened ox at his subject's expense.  A feeling of compassion is requisite for power, but he sacrificed his subject's happiness and that of a sheep for something tangible, which was not wise.  There are different types of inability, those which are truly impossible and those which require more skill than one has; lack of virtue is the latter.  A monarch searches for power, but this is often intenible without virtue.  With benevolent rule, those who desire benevolence will go to a ruler's court and thus outnumber other states.  For stability, provide stable livleihoods and promote filial piety.  Allocate resources to the elderly and make the people live moderately.  (1B5) Allocating indulgences to the populace makes personal love of indulgences unimportant.  (1B6) Insufficient rulers should be deposed, but they will not resign even if they would not tolerate such performance by their subordinates.  (1B8) Killing unjust rulers is acceptable.

### 2
(2A6)  Humans are distinctly emotional and caring, and so too should governments.  People who are disdainful and/or indifferent to suffering are not human.  By caring for the "four sprouts" and filling them out, one becomes virtuous.

### 4
(4A17)  Ritual can be broken for the sake of compassion.  However, compassion does not require the breaking of all ritual; it is situational.  Sometimes one has to help physically, other times you can aid the world by following the way.

### 5
(5A2)  One can also break filial piety and ritual if the alternative is resentment toward them.  One can be tricked by something that follows their virtues, but not what goes against.

### 6
(6A1)  Mengzi responds to Gaozi  (a fellow Confucian) saying that righteousness is robbing the human soul of what is instinctive, saying it is a false premise.  (6A2)  He counters Gaozi's argument that human nature is neither benevolent or malevolent, saying that humanity tends towards goodness.  Instead, malevolence comes from being restrained from practicing benevolence.  (6A3)  Nature is not life, as that would group humans with animals.  (6A4)  He also counters external vs internal tendencies.  (6A5)  Outward respect is fluid with regard to the role of people in certain situations.  (6A6)  All people have the capacity for goodness, but it is lost if not exercised.  Thus, human nature can be good even if people are bad.  (6A7)  Humans, like crops, develop differently due to external situations, but are internally the same.  (6A8)  Again, if virtue is attacked it will rot, if it is nourished it will grow.  (6A10)  You can desire life and righteousness and still prefer righteousness.  (6A12)  Even if a finger is useless, if it is broken people will dislike it; the same principle does not apply to hearts and virtue.  (6A15)  Sensory organs just follow, but by reflecting with the heart one can become virtuous.

### 7
(7A35) Punishment sometimes forgets humanity.  (7B31)  By extending virtuous, instinctive behaviors one can become benevolent and righteous.
