# Qianlong Emperor
Temple name Gaozong, personal name Hongli
Ruled the [[Qing Dynasty]] from 1735-1795, de facto until death 1799.
## Expansionism
Ruled longer as emperor emeritus. Huge territorial expansion, near to the borders of modern China. Takes over [[Xinjiang]] in 1755 against the Zunghars. The ruler is treated as a rebel and traitor, not a foreign head of state.
Had "Ten Complete Victories," defeated domestic foes (Taiwan rebels, Jinchuan Tusi highlanders), foreign enemies ([[Vietnam]], [[Burma]], [[Gurkha]]), he wrote his own stamps and poetry on precious art. Kim's interprestation: Xinjian and Taiwan were complete victories, the Jinchuan campaigns, Gurkha, Vietnam, and Burma campaigns were mixed, the last of which solidified the independence of Burma and the modern border between China and Myanmar, and the Vietnam campaign was a military loss but win under the [[Tributary System]]. These campaigns overextended Qing and led to deficit. The Qing army was routed in the Tay Son campaign, but the Qing reestablished tributary relationship with Vietnam. 
It was not clear at all, after the 1758-60 Altishahr campaign, that Qing would stop expanding in Xinjiang. Qing wish for more tributary rulers, Central Asian leaders. Karun guardposts were seen as demarkators of boundaries of the Qing, more autonomy and less troop presence beyond. Altishahr was under a [[Mercantalist]] renaissance under Qing rule. Influx of troops meant less control over food and water by locals: led to influx of silver to Xinjiang. Xinjiang was highly settled: due to desertification Altishahr was a highly urban region. Kirghiz are seen as heretical, deceitful by settled [[Uyghurs]]
