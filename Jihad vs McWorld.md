# Jihad vs McWorld
The author conceptualizes two trends in the wake of the [[Fall of the Soviet Union]], that of neoliberal globalism (McWorld), and a fractionalization of politics (Jihad, struggle). McWorld is driven by market incentives, with [[Capitalism]] not necessarily leading to democracy, and occasionally trampling on democratic settlement and leads to ecological collapse. It is an impossible force to ignore: even the [[United States]] ended its isolationist experiment of a yeoman republic, with new information technologies making it even easier for global (American) culture to spread. Jihad is an antipodal force, which seeks to make smaller nation states ([[Palestine]], [[Chechnya]]) out of larger ones, which would lead to conflict and excuses for dictatorship. Both of these pull away from democracy. The proposed solution is regional communities uniting in loose confederations (a la [[Articles of Confederation]]), a marker of both local and global thinking.
#### Personal Thoughts
Snark, snark, snark. [[Greek City States]] fell, Articles of Confederation failed. A multipolar world would strictly lead to more terror, more war, less security. The nation state model is imperfect but works, this new model seems to require far more human goodness and benevolence than exists.
