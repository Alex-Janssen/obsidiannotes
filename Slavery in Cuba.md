# Slavery in Cuba
## History
Slavery in [[Cuba]] is tremendously linked to Cuba's agricultural industry, especially tobacco, sugar, and coffee. In the early 1700s, slavery was used, but in the early part of the century it increased to the point where slave importation took up a substantial portion of Spanish shipping capacity. [[Spain]] was unable to help procure slaves in Cuba, and thus Cuba's production was rather independent of the metropolis, and Cuba instead relied more on British importation, especially after the British occupation of Havana which imported as many slaves in months as would have normally been imported for several years, accelerating the trend of dependence on the slave workforce. This also made slavery more brutal and introduced stricter ideas of racial hierarchy to the island. Cuba formed a close relationship with the [[United States]] for importation of foodstuffs for slaves, and thus the [[American Revolution]] led to the starvation of many.
By the mid 1700s, slavery was widespread and brutal in the sugar industry. This was about the time when small producers were threatened by larger, more efficient plantations, and development was halted by dependence on agricultural slavery. British slave traders illegally imported slaves to the island, but the quantity did not match demand, and Cuba was hungry for more hands in the fields. In the mid 1700s, the average plantation had 80 slaves, which would later balloon to about 100.
Cuba was directly benefitted by the [[Haitian Revolution]], but [[Haiti]] transforming from a sugar-king to a slave-led state scared many whites in Cuba. In the 1800s, the system had changed little, only the scale. Advancement under a slave-system was impossible but [[Abolition of Slavery]] was unpalatable for the slave-owning aristocracy.
Throughout the 1500s-1800s, production per slave in ingenios was constant, showing the inefficiency of Cuban sugar agriculture.
There was also trade in [[Chinese Immigration|Chinese Immigrant]], time limited contracts in the 1850s.

## Description of Slave Experiences
Slaves generally lived in a barracoon, a sort of house with generally dirt floors and poor conditions inside. Slaves were able to tend to small gardens or crops, and, in some cases, were able to amass enough wealth to buy their own freedom. More often, however, they would be ruthlessly put to work while still finding amusement in unique forms of music and dance. Often tall men were forced to mate with certain healthy women, and women who did not give birth yearly were punished.
Chinese temporary slaves had giant suicide rates, due to being taken to a foreign land and held in prisonlike conditions for 8 years in exchange for a tiny wage and clothes, with a population from 60-200k.

## Reactions
Some white Cubans wanted abolition, albeit for vastly divergent reasons. Some believed in the evil of slavery, that institutional inequality meant the antithesis of liberty and constitution that Cuba fought for. Others were afraid of a domination of the island by the black majority, fearing a fate like [[Jamaica]] or [[Haiti]].
