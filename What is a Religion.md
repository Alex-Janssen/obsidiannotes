# What is a Religion
## Guiding Questions
What separates a religion from a sect? A cult? Myth?
How does politics interfere with these questions and belief?

## Thoughts
On the discussion in class about Sarnaism, a quasi-animist, nature worshipping religion of ~5 million in India, not being a scheduled religion, why would it be forcibly considered [[Hinduism]]? The 2023 BJP government wishes to see a Hindu-nationalist India, and so absorbing other groups into Hinduism is a tool for this goal, but, in my view, a religion crosses to be a religion on the basis of sincere self-identification, although this leaves loopholes of cults.
For instance, I think that, unlike [[Christianity]] or [[Islam]], it is very simple to have a philosophical view of [[Confucianism]] and [[Daoism]]. While both have quasi-religious versions, neither of which I have studied well enough at this point to comment on, these traditions also have a stronger, text-based philosophical upbringing. Sarnaism, as far as we discussed, lacks such a text, but text-based views of religion are limited in scope (Dr. Huntington mentioned that this is believed to be due to the influence of sola-scriptura [[Protestantism]] on religious studies in America). [[Mozi|Mohism]], under no definition, would be considered a religion, because there is also no ritual attached. Confucianism prescribes ritual, but under no higher power.
