# Ming-Qing Transition

## Overview
The conventional view takes the 1644 capture of Beijing as a simple dividing line between the [[Ming Dynasty]] and Qing rule. Newer views place the 1636 founding of the [[Qing Dynasty]], which lead to the 1644 capture of [[Beijing]], 1661 capture of Southwest China, and taking of [[Taiwan]] in 1683. [[Joseon Korea]] was defeated first in 1637 in greater importance. [[Manchu]] sources have given us more perspective on the transition. Manchu and Chinese materials often change in nuance, with records occasionally explicitly saying to not translate something to Chinese. Some rebel regimes rose up after the fall of the Ming. 
## Ramifications with Korea
The Ming aid during the [[Imjin War]] made the Ming-Joseon aliance substantially closer. The [[Later Jin Dynasty]] [[Jurchens]] declared war against Ming, with Korea being neutral. After 1627, Joseon is an ally after a war. Joseon refused to recognize the Qing in 1637, with the Qing defeating Korea militarily and creating a tributary state. Often, Machus tried to create solidarity with Korea, but Manchus also used steppe identity to distinguish themselves from the Sinitic cultural sphere.
## Ramifications with Inner Asia
With Tibetan Buddhism, Qing used it as a means to make allies with Mongols. They take the [[Yuan Dynasty]] seal from the Chakhars, gaining more legitimacy to rule [[China]]. They first incorporated the area of [[Inner Mongolia]], later spreading to the modern nation of [[Mongolia]]. [[Russia]], during the [[Russian Colonization of SIberia]], received substantial income from fur. The Qing and Joseon fought against the Russians in isolated battles and signed its first modern treaty (Wikipedia and lecture, Qing, in the Treaty of Nerchinsk of 1689, had to relax tributary language with regards to Russia, diplomatic flexibility from the [[Tributary System]]). 
## Ramifications with the Maritime World
The VOC was baesd of Taiwan, with the Zheng Regime partially unseating the Dutch after 1662, which was later taken over again by the Qing in 1683.
