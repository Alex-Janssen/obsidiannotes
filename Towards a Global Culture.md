# Towards a Global Culture
With culture and nations being built on history, specific events and figures which teach belonging and cultivate unity within a group, a global culture would have to be timeless and memoryless, possessing no attachment to the past. When new elements are introduced, either foreign or completely novel, they are traditionally grafted in a vernacularly recognizable way. In the [[Cold War]], the USA and [[Soviet Union]] developed two larger models of culture, the USA having a diverse culture where surface-level ties to your motherland are subsumed by an attachment to American ideals, land, and events, and the USSR where a broader political fraternization united the SSRs. A global culture is seen as difficult for those who see the lack of complete success by movements such as [[Pan-Africanism]] and [[Pan-Turkism]], but these movements have successfully built ties between countries, negotiating some identity between other, preexisting ones. This could be a blueprint for a future global culture.
