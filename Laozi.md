# Laozi
## Background
Laozi was the likely mythical founder of [[Daoism]], a philosophy highly distinct to that of the dominant [[Confucianism]].  Indeed, it is highly possible that Laozi's work, the Daodejing, was a composite work from myriad sources.  Chapters 1-37 are divded to signify with the Way (Dao), and chapters 38-81 deal with virtue (De).  Daodejing means  _the classic of Dao and De_, even if the chapters are only divided like this because the beginning of chapter one is Dao and 38 is De, and does not reflect the contents.  It was also written during the [[Warring States Period]] like [[Confucianism]] and is possibly a reaction to the instability it caused.  Specifically, it views excess desires as unnatural and evil, and human nature is mostly modest.  The Dao is the source, sustinance, and ideal state of all things, thus supporting the idea of non-intervention (Wuwei).  Humans have a place in the world but are not special in the Dao.  The Daodejing is supposed to challenge and move the soul, not present arguments.
## Chapter Summaries
## Book 1
### 1
The way that can be named is not the true way.
Elimnate desires to observe its mysteries, have desires to observe its manifestations.
Unity brings enigma, which is a deeper enigma, the gate of all mysteries.
### 2
When beauty is for beauty's sake, it is repulsive.  When good is for goodness's sake, it is not good.
Having begets lacking, lacking begets having.  You cannot have difficulty without easiness.
This enforces non-action.
### 3
Not honoring desires weakens desire.
Knowledge is not beneficial.
### 4
The way is empty but unfillable, "blunts sharpness".
### 5
Heaven and earth are not benevolent, sages are not as well.
### 6
?
### 7
Heaven does not live for itself, and thus endures.  Sages come first because they put themselves last.
### 8
The highest good is like water.  It does not contend or act, but benefits all.  Goodness is avoiding contention.
### 9
Greed is undoing to the soul and becomes counterproductive.
### 10
?
### 11
Objects function partially because of what is not there.  Non-action is action.  What is there gives profit, what is not there gives use.
### 12
Luxury dwindles luxury.
### 13
Be apprehensive of favor and grace, but revere calamity.  Take care of your body.
### 14
It is impossible to grasp the way.  Knowing ancient origins and practicing the way can give you a thread.
### 15
The greatest ancient scholars were enigmatic.
### 16
Every creature returns to its route.  Constancy is part of the path to embody the way.
### 17
The greatest ruler is clandestine and unoticible, better than to be loved.
### 18
In chaos there is are remenants of goodness, and in goodness there are remenants of chaos.
### 19
Embrace fewer desires and think of others and the people will benefit.
### 20
Being childlike, not learned and still is embodying the way.
### 21
We know the origin of all things through the way.
### 22
Those who are "broken" will be repaired.  Their humility causes their fame.
### 23
Sparring with words is natural like a blustury wind, but quickly vanishes.  Heaven and earth cannot sustain contention, much less humans.
### 24
Converse of 22, those who brag and make themselves outwardly known are not respected and fail.
### 25
Laozi does not know the name, but calls it the way, but would call it "Great."  A true king is the first of the great things.  People model themselves off of earth, earth heaven, heaven the way, the way nature.
### 26
Kings take their roles in the world too lightly.  They must be heavy and still, not light and agitated.
### 27
A good person is a teacher of the bad, bad material for the good.  Those who are talented leave few traces of their efforts.
### 28
Know the male but preserve the female.  Carve nothing off.
### 29
The world is a spiritual vessel and so cannot be used unless one ruins it.  Sages favor moderation.
### 30
Those who rule with the way do not use armed force as it will then come back to them.
### 31
Fine weapons are repulsive (but can be used if absolutely necessary).  Peace and quiet are high ideals.  Military victory is not beautiful; it is slaughter.
### 32
Unhewn wood is not mastered even if insignificant.  If it could be mastered, there would be peace.  (Master it through the way, a methaphor for how with the way all things can come under your control?)
### 33
Knowing and conquering others gives you knowledge and power, but true strength and wisdom comes from knowing and conquering yourself.
### 34
The way is omnipresent.  It nourishes but does not lord.
### 35
By holding onto the "divine image" you can pacify the world.  While "insipid" and underappreciated, it can sustain the world indefinitely.
### 36
Subtle enlightenment is knowing that in order for something to become weak, it must have been made strong, or to abandon something means it must have flourished.  The supple and weak conquer hard and strong.  The sharpness of politics should not come into contact with the people.
### 37
The way does nothing.  Unhewn wood is without desire, and if kings and barons could master wuwei then the whole world would be transformed.
## Book 2
### 38
You cannot gain virtue by striving for virtue, you can gain virtue by not striving for it.  Thos who are benevolent act without ulterior motives, those who are righteous act with ulterior motives (so do not act).  The rites are a product of the decline of the way and virtue, and also wear trust and loyalty thin and beget chaos.
### 39
All things flourish with the one, and thus baseness is honored.  Desire what rumbles like a rock, not jingles like jade.
### 40
The way operates with weakness.
### 41
The best scholars put this learning to practice, mediocre sometimes do, the worst mock it.  It is hidden and vague.
### 42
The way is the root of one, which is the root of everything.  Diminishing a thing can add to it, adding to a thing can diminish it.
### 43
What is not there (including action) can reach into emptiness.
### 44
Know contentment and be moderate.
### 45
Perfection seems lacking but is endless.  Fullness seems empty but cannot be drained.
### 46
The worst calamity is the desire to acquire.  "And so those who know the contentment of contentment are always content."
### 47
You can learn of all things by examining anything.
### 48
Learning makes one do more, following the way makes one do less.  By doing nothing, nothing is left undone.
### 49
Be good to all out of virtue (against [[Confucianism]], responding tit-for-tat).
### 50
People who nurture life have no place for death.
### 51
All things revere the way as their creator naturally, not by decree.
### 52
The world has a beginning, the way is its mother.
### 53
The way is smooth and easy, but people take shortcuts.  Being rich in poor times is pride in robbery.
### 54
What is grounded will not be pulled out.  Ground virtue in the family and the state will follow.
### 55
Those who are virtuous face little calamity.
### 56
Those who talk about the way do not know it, those who don't do.
### 57
The state demands regularity.  Military demands unpredictability.  The more laws and cleverness, the more criminals and strange inventions, thus no action gets rid of this.
### 58
People are more active and lively the less the government controls.
### 59
Frugality is virtuous, it is submitting early on.
### 60
Ruling a state is like cooking a small fish.  Sages and ghosts do not harm humans through the way.
### 61
A great state nurtures the world through stillness like a delta of a river.  It does so through subordination.  By placing oneself below, one can take or be taken and in both cases prosper.
### 62
The way saves the bad and is treasured by the good.  It is absolution from crime and can make the bad good.
### 63
Be active but have no activities.  All great undertakings start with what is small.
### 64
A great tree originated from a tiny sprout.  A journey of a thousand leagues began with a single step.  People often ruin things on the verge of success.  Be as careful in the end as you are in the beginning.
### 65
Great rulers kept people in the dark and did not enlighten them.  People are hard to govern because they know too much.
### 66
Rivers go over many valleys because they place themselves beneath.  By proclaiming one is below others you become above them.
### 67
If the way appeared early, it would have dissapeared.  Kidness, frugality, and selflessness are virtues.  Corageouness, generosity, and leadership sprout from these virtues, but kill without them.
### 68
Those who are good at attacking are never enraged.  Do not contend.
### 69
Military success is often formless.  Underestimation is the key villain.
### 70
No one has implemented Laozi's teachings even though they are easy.
### 71
It is best to know that one does not know.  Sages know that false confidence is a disease, and thus do not have it.
### 72
Do not constrain the people or oppress them.  Sages do not revere others.
### 73
The way can create plans without anxiety, respond without speaking.  Being corageous in daring is death, in not daring is life (militarily I assume), and both bring some benefit and some loss.  Heaven's mesh is loose but misses nothing.
### 74
The executioner is the greatest carver among carpenters, the greatest carver rarely avoids wounding their own hands.  Do not threaten people with death.
### 75
Hunger comes from taxes by the greed of the elite.  They are difficult to govern because of the activity of the elite.  Not striving to live is more worthy than cherishing life.
### 76
Dead humans are stronger and harder than live ones.  Being stiff and strong, inflexible, is the root of death.
### 77
The way presses down what is high and lifts up the low.  It equalizes.  The way of human beings creates more inequalities.
### 78
Water is the most supple and weak of all things and conquers all.  Straightforward words seem paradoxical.
### 79
Resentment always remains, and thus cannot be considered good.  The Way of Heaven plays no favorites but always favors the good.
### 80
Reduce the size of the state and lessen the population.  Get rid of labor saving tools.  Make their lives comfortable and happy.  Decrease their curiosity about the outside world.
### 81
Words worthy of trust are unrefined.  Those who know are not full of knowledge.  The Way of Heaven is to benefit but not harm, the way of the sage is to act but not content
