# Confucius' Analects
## Background
Written in the [[Warring States Period]], the Analects by Kongzi was a text complied by Kongzi's students (Kongzi himself did not see reason to write a text).  He sought a central authority and the stability formerly provided by the [[Zhou Dynasty]].  These texts were largely written on brief bamboo scrolls, possibly including outsider's commentary, and partially passed down orally.  Thus, pieces of _The Analects_ are not well integrated.  This text is one of, if not the, most important document for [[Confucianism]].
(Adapted from lectures)

## 1
1: Being learned and virtuous is pleasurable in and of itself.
2: Filial Piety is the foundation of virtue, as it instills stability and wards off revolt.  Filial piety is political.
3: Exterior beauty and wit is vanity and is not virtuous.
4: Be trustworthy, consistant, and dutiful.
11: Honor thy father even after his death; this shows respect.
12: Sticking to ritual for ritual's sake is not sufficient for virtue (Don't fully understand).
15: Joy and ritual trump lack of arrogance, knowing what has happened is the foundation for further learning.
Why is virtue filial piety?  Why is the lack of revolt virtuous, and why does Confucius not examine this argument?

## 2
1: Being virtuous leads to reputation and firm roots.
2: Odes are often referenced, what are they?
3: People will be permenantly changed by ritual, versus force which scares them but does not change their ways.
5: Filial piety means respect (also I love that Confucius is complaining about the young generation)
15: Learning without reflection leads to confusion, but thinking without learning leads to danger.
19: Raise the upper class to humble themseles instead of raising the lower class to the upper. (Don't fully understand)
21: Filial Piety is, in a way, a contribution to governance.
How is family related to politics?  How do father-son and leader-citizen hierarchies relate and differ?

## 3
3: Conflation of virtue and music.
4: Be sparse in ritual, but be very mournful.
8: Many such lines of Confucius talking to a disciple and Confucius saying that they understand the Odes, why is this so emphasized?
11: Confucius sees some rituals as holding fundamental mysteries.
14: Loyalty to the [[Zhou Dynasty]].
17: When Zigong does not sacrifice the lamb in ritual, Zigong mourns the lamb wheras Kongzi mourns the rite.
18: Consequences to being overly meticulous in ritual, people wrongly think that it is for show.
23: Music reaches perfection beginning from chaos.
Why does Confucius elevate the arts, in 1 dance and in 3 music?  What purpose does he view them as serving in society?
23 is fascinating to me and seems very Daoist, that there is perfection in chaos.  This seems very unconfucian, as this is an endorsment of stability as emergent from instability.

## 4
1: Be surrounded by those who are good.
3: One can only truly love or hate when one is good.
4: Sincerely wishing to be good is enough to rid oneself of evilness.
5: Wealth and power are not to be respected if not gained legitimately, and poverty and disgrace should only be avoided in "the proper way."
6: No one truly loves goodness.
9: The way means abandoning mortal desires.
10: Allegiance is against the way, truth is the way.
12: Pursuing profit leads to resentment against you.
14: Pursue becoming a person worth knowing rather than power.
15: Confucianism is dutifulness tempered by sympathy.
17: Imitate those who are good, and reflect on yourself when talking to those who are not.
18: Follow your parents' lead unconditionally respectfully.
19: Do not travel far from parents.
20: is a repeat of 1.11
22: People did not speak in ancient times in case their actions were inferior to speech.
24: A gentleman is slow to speak but quick to act.

## 5
4: Zigong is a precious ritual vessel, too rigid.
9: To Zigong, Kongzi says he is not as good as Yanhui.
11: Zaiwo is intelligent but his conduct is not good.
12: Zigong quoted the golden rule: “What I do not wish others to do unto me, I also wish not to do unto others."  Confucius admonishes this, implying that he is more rigid than the other disciples.
22: Difference between having a show of culture and shaping it.
26: Kongzi wishes to: "bring comfort to the aged, to inspire trust in my friends, and be cherished by the youth.”
27: Even if faults are ascertained, it is exceedingly rare to change.
What even is goodness?  Is it just ren and filial piety and ritual?

## 6
3: Yan Hui was only the disciple who loved learning, but he soon passed away.
5: Declining salary is foolish if you could serve others with it, especially if the declining comes from wanting to be seen as virtuous.
12: Difference between not having strength to follow the way and not attempting to.
20: Hierarchy of knowledge < love < joy for the way.
22: Wisdom is to keep spirits happy and to promote harmony between the people.
23: The wise are active, the good are still.
27: A person is dependable if they are cultured and follow ritual.
30: Someone is good if they let others make their stand, an idea of shu, or sympathetic understanding.
What is the difference between being wise and good?
Is the Way in Daoism and Confucianism the same idea?
Confucianism is highly contextual, 6.5 is an inversion of previous verses due to the scenario and intent, feeds into Confucius not wishing to write down his ideas in order for them to fluidly come.
If Kongzi's rules are impossible to follow, even from himself, how does he view his role as a teacher?  How much impact does Kongzi believe he has?

## 7
3: Kongzi himself fails to acquire virtue, be introspective enough, and unable to change, the same criticisms he has for others.
5: Another reference to Zhou loyalty, in this case dreaming of meeting the king.
6: Follow way, cultivate virtue, explore the arts, and lean into Goodness.
7: Sacrifice to others is a signal of virtue.
8: One can only learn if they are willing to learn.
12: Wealth is not worth pursuing.
14: Music distracted Kongzi from basic pleasures.
16: Joy in ascetism.
17: With more time, Kongzi could learn more and rid himself of faults.
18: Kongzi maintained traditional ways of undergoing rituals.
20: Kongzi finds knowledge in antiquity.
23: Virtue is endowed by heaven.
33: Kongzi is not a gentleman, but says he is unequaled in cultural refinement.
37: Being virtuous leads to relaxation, pursuit of profit leads to misery.
Why is living a simple life and giving to the poor a nigh universal constant in ethical codes?
Is Confucianism a reason why the Chinese aristocracy often promoted the arts?

## 8
2: Virtues without ritual deteriorate, only by ritual can you maintain goodness.  Kindness to others resonates.
8: Arts are again stressed.
9: Common people do not understand ritual, but they can follow it.  (What is it?  Goodness, ritual?)
13: Only abandon asceticism when the way is followed, and love learning.  Wealth is a shame without the way.
Are arts necessary for goodness?  Why is pursuit of the arts so important to Kongzi?
Why are emperors repeatedly praised even as wealth and power are derided?

## 9
2: Kongzi does not see the use in mastering a technical skill.
3: Follow the majority when in ritual changes lead to virtue, don't when they lead to vice.
10: Treat those going through hardship as equals.
11: A master feels the desire to follow the way imparted by Kongzi, but cannot understand how.
13: Virtue should be recognized and not actively shown, don't try to serve, but be called to serve.
17: Rivers continue always, a continuous process (Daoist metaphor).
23: Be patient with the younger generation, but do not hold that patience indefinitely (40-50).
24: If you are corrected, correct yourself, if you are praised, live up to yourself.
28: Only after tragedy do we know what lasts.
How should those with virtue act in the world?  Should they try to spread it or maintain humility?

## 10
2: Treat all people with respect in different ways.
11: Hold fast to ritual no matter what.
12: Attend to the details in ritual/life.
17: Value people over possesions.
23: Treat all religious matters with more gravity than all non-religious (bow for sacrificial meat but not a horse as a gift).
Why are different classes of officer/worker held differently?  Why do hierarchies between strangers exist?

## 11
4: Sycophants are worthless.
8: Don't hold your own family above station. (?)
9: Even after disrespecting this man (Yan Hui), he is agonized by his death.
12: You can't understand death before life.
17: Rebellion against greedy rulers is warranted.
22: Differing advice for people with different weaknesses are warranted.  (Confucianism is highly contextual).
26: Building a state starts with ritual: only wanting to bring prosperity is worthless.  Pursuing ritual in and of itself is as virtuous as leading people toward virtue.  This was in the context of Kongzi saying that disciples complain too much about not being appreciated, and what they would do if appreciated.
How is it respectful to agree or disagree?  Only agreeing is seen as being worthless, but where is the line between that and disrespect?
11.17 seems to me an early formulation of the idea of a Mandate of Heaven.  How is this not a violation of filial piety?
11.26 uses a common narritive device of these dialogues, but how does this serve the reader?  Why are so many negative examples shown with far fewer positive?

## 12
1: Restraint to the rites is goodness.
2: Actual golden rule this time, and treat all affairs seriously.
7: Confidence of the people is more important than food, better to let people die than lose stability.
9: A lord cannot tax more if the people are satisfied.  Their hapineses should be interlinked.
11: Stability would be emergent from people following their duties instead of employing strategies to rule.
13: Litigation is best avoided.
18: Desire is the root of vice.
19: The common people "bend like grass" to the upper echelons "like the strong wind."  If those who are elite are virtuous, then the people follow.
22: If the straight are crooked, then the crooked are straight. (?)
24: Friends are crucial in becoming good.
In 12.5, there is a seperation between fate and heaven; what is this?
How is stability seen?  Why is Kongzi willing to let common people die for the sake of stability?  Was this an overreaction to the Civil War?
What does the crooked-straight metaphor mean?  Raising commoners?

## 13
3: Rectifying names is the most important thing in order for speech to match reality, which will harm ritual and make the populace restless.
4: Technical skills, such as agriculture, are useless when ritual is maintained.
5: Education is only useful if you can apply what you have learned.
16: Keep constiuents happy and appease enemies.
18: You can lie to protect family.  Filial piety is more important than honesty. 
24: Popularity is only important among the good.
Is Confucius anti-education/science?  He seems to regard all but ritual and filial piety as useless.
Does 13.18 universally apply?  How does Confucius order virtues?
13.3 is also a commentary on Kingdom of Wei who did not maintain royal lineage., compoare to 12.11

## 14
1: Only accept salary as an official when the country is on the right path.  Goodness is not necessarily lack of sin.
4: Courage and insight is a property of the way, but not unique to it.
5: Using historical parallels, virtue conquers military might.
12: A complete person is either "perfect" in good times or does not lose sight of the way in bad.
24: Learn for your own sake, not other people's.
27: Do not let words exceed your actions.
29: Evaluating others is wasted time, cultivate yourself.
30: Fear lack of ability more than lack of recognition.
34: Do not respond to injury with kindness, rather uprightness.
38: Derisive comment reclaimed, that Confucians does what he knows is impossible.
This chapter seems to set up ambiguity, conditions which are necessary but not sufficient for the way.
How inward-focused is Confucianism?  How do you reconcile the dual motivations of inward perfection and outward piety?

## 15
1: Ritual is more important to statebuilding than military.
2: Gentleman is more resiliant to hardship.
16: Analyzing actions is necessary for improvement of situation.
21: Seek goodness in yourself, not others.
28: Popular opinion is not an endorsement or criticism of a person.
29: The way is changed by humans, not the other way around.
31: Asceticism without purpose is meaningless.
36: Teachers do not know more about being good.  Trust yourself.
39: All people can be educated.
41: Be succinct in speech.

## 16
4: Friendship can be helpful or harmful.
5: As can joy.
7: Chastity is a virtue
8: That which is praised by gentlemen is derided by fools.
9: Natural talent trumps effort.
13: Don't give knowledge to a person which you wouldn't give to everybody: no family privilege.

## 17
2: Human nature is universal, but bent by habit.
8: Love of virtues without learning becomes vice.
11: Music and ritual are not just objects, but need humans to embody them (similar to 15.29)
21: Mourning should remove joys of life, three years as children are dependent on parents for three years.
25: Misogyny in Analects, refers to women as something to be controlled.

## 18
6: A love of the world precludes a life of solitude.
7: Avoiding social contact is "an easy way out."

## 19
6: Goodness is found in learning and remembering lessons.
7: Learning to reach the way is akin to perfecting craft in workshop.
11: Minor breaches in virtue are permissible.
21: An error as a gentleman is noticible, but so too is apology

## 20
3: Understand fate, ritual, and speech.
