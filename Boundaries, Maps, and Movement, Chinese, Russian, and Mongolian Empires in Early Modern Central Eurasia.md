# Boundaries, Maps, and Movement, Chinese, Russian, and Mongolian Empires in Early Modern Central Eurasia

## Introduction
The fall of any semblence of a steppe-nomadic [[Mongolia]] was one of the greatest changes brought on by the [[Qing Dynasty]], harolded by the domination of the [[Zunghars]] in 1760. This event brought the Chinese-[[Russia|Russian]] border into focus, with a divide between Inner and Central Asia being this historic dividing line. The 1600s saw map-making enter the Asian sphere as a tool of demarkating influence, as seen in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Safavid Persia]] deliniating their boundary. The Chinese and Russian project to make a border halted nomadic communities and created the impetus to define formerly fluid identities.
[[Siberia]] was a refuge from serfdom, and the [[Manchu]] imposed the banner system less stringently on border areas. Borders meant that formerly untied individuals had to choose between Russia, China, or a Mongolia which formerly was unable to compel subjects to stay loyal (anyone could have moved out, as nearly the whole population was nomadic). A Siberian, Gantimur, fled Russia to Qing in 1654, only to later return to Siberia. A Qing request for Gantimur was met with a request to submit to the Tsar: both Russia and China saw themselves as more civilized than the other. (The [[Kowtow]] was not a central diplomatic issue, unlike later missions.) Gantimur became a security interest to both parties. This incident led to a recognition that demarkating the border would be of the interest of both sides, with the Qing having even tighter control over its mobile population than the Russians. A border conflicti in 1685 led to a 1689 agreement that future deserters would be returned.
[[France]] was the first major nation to understand the power of maps politically, with cartography seen as having defensive, political, economic, and religious ramifications. Maps are social constructions of space and are inherently cultural, an idea further explored in the history of science in general. Chinese ideas along these lines were prevalent throughout history, but most under the Kangxi emperor. Areas not controlled by China were marked as blank space, with the only non-town object being the Great Wall, a traditional frontier. The Russian maps of the time project complexity, with China and smaller kingdoms named and borders not fully marked. At this time, science served power. A [[Sweden|Swedish]] captive made indigenous maps for Mongolia. A different Swedish captive made a map of Russian Siberia which brought forward the idea of the Urals being the [[Europe-Asia Border]].
Maps have huge political importance, to the point that 18th century Qing maps are considered national security concerns in modern [[China]] and are not viewable by researchers. East Asian nationalism is often thought of as a benign offshoot of imperial heritage or a vestige of [[Asian Colonization]]: the border consciousness gained by the Qing shows some hint of a different flavor of nationalism. The [[Ming Dynasty]] excluded nomads, the Qing wanted to incorporate them.
