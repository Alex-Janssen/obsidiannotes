## Biography
Rama was a son of a king and avatar of [[Vishnu]] who is venerated as a deity by some [[Hinduism|Hindus]]. He is the principle character in the Hindu epic the [[The Ramayana of Valmiki|Ramayana]]. A blessed and popular prince, he is to be made king with his wife [[Sita]] but is instead exiled by his father's jealous wife. In his forest exile, he is cast in a battle against the rakasa Ravana, and becomes allies with [[Hanuman]], a monkey hero, to defeat Ravana in Lanka. After the battle, he forces Sita, having been in the room of another man, to undergo a trial by fire, which she passes, proving her purity. However, with rumours circulating the kingdom, he still casts her aside, causing her to be swallowed by the Earth and Rama to also die by his own accord.

Some Hindu worshippers will tattoo "Ram" on their bodies repeatedly, the word itself having power. His name is also commonly chanted.
