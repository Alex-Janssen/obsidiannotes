# Cherishing Men from Afar, Qing Guest Ritual and the Macartney Embassy Of 1793

## Introduction
The British Lord Macartney visited the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] emperor eager to demonstrate his respect to Chinese customs and ideas. Instead of kowtowing, he kneeled, and presented a gift to the emperor, receiving a jade scepter in return. This study attempts to view this not as a turning point per-se of the Qing Dynasty, but rather in the light of modern developments of [[Asian Colonization]] and imperialism, and viewing Qing change through the light of internal factors.
Anti-colonial and feminist movements reevaluated imperialism away from purely economic explanations, influenced by new [[Marxism|Marxist]] narratives. Included were gender dynamics in colonialism, the impact of fiction as a narrative-building tool, intersectionality of gender, class, and race in constructing colonial identity, with groups such as the [[Subaltern Group]] revolutionizing imperialist thought. Representation in the process of building knowledge is a major focal point, as it is a crucial source of knowledge itself: it is what is being observed. European gaze and recording of foreign places informs much of European knowledge of the outside world, an ontological focus on vision as the primary organ of knowledge transmission. [[Orientalism]] has also influenced the conversation, arguing that knowledge of the Orient derives from its European domination, coming from a perspective of a superior European observer describing the Orient as it is. Orientalist representations in fact produced truth later, thus influencing reality and making their impact inescapable. The book is influenced by post-colonial and China area studies thought, with [[British Empire|British]], American, and Chinese representations as events in and of themselves.

## A Multitude of Lords
The Qing Dynasty is treated as the ultimate stage of Chinese history, erasing its [[Manchu]] influence. Chinese nationalists have both condemned and applauded the Qing. The Qing imperial project was innovative and different to that of the [[Ming Dynasty]].
The Qing saw leaders as "king of kings," overlord to lords throughout the world. Policy was directed at protecting East and Inner Asian hegemony. Ritual created hierarchy and was infused with details in location that bolstered legitimacy. They took Ming hierarchy and created balanced ruling classes between Manchus and [[Han Chinese]], a way of keeping control over the numerically superior Han. The Qing were afraid of unrest, but a similar ethnically Han dynasty would have likely feared it as well.
Qing Inner Asia was linked to the [[Silk Road]] and [[Bukharan Khanate]]. Chinggisid lineage was highly influential in the region. Inner Asian control was mostly complete by the reign of the Qianlong Emperor. [[Tibet|Tibetan]] [[Buddhism]] was actively supported by Qing. The Qing attempted to place lamas as worldly lords, subservient to the emperor. Lamas believed themselves superior lords to earthly rulers. European misdeeds meant punishment for their entire group.

## Review: Cherishing Sources from Afar
Hevia's book is seen as rooted in postmodernism to be applied in China studies. The MacCartney embassy is well studied, meaning that Hevia's fanfare is remarkable. It seeks to center Chinese sources in the meeting, despite leaving some Jesuit sources unused. It rejects the [[Tributary System]] in favor of Qing Guest Ritual, and uses [[Orientalism]] as a major framework. He believes ritual structures power and is flexible, how it gives power is not explained. Sinocentricism was replaced with overlordship, removing ideas of Sinitic culture being naturally superior. The [[British Empire]] was seen as an inflexible culture, while the Qing tried to be inclusive of others in power. The idea of the meeting of two imperialisms and the "A Multitude of Lords" chapter's centering of Buddhism are commendable. He uses no new sources, but seeks to reinterpret them to reconstruct meaning without these preconceived notions.
There are numerous translation errors in the glossary. He often inserts physical meaning into words with no such connotation. Traditional narratives have generally not been attacked on the accuracy of embassy events Hevia criticises, with trade orientation being seen in newer readings of the texts. "Cherishing" in Cherishing Men from Afar may be seen as "pacify with gracious treatment," something which counters Hevia's goal to show foreigners as welcome pre-[[Opium War]]. Qianlong is aware that there is more danger in the embassy than mishandling of ritual, and that success was not due to this lack of ritual order.
Hevia only translates from the preface of the deliniation of ritual protocol, even containing errors here. Hevia enriches the vocabulary of ritual studies, but the Qing had a real committment to ritual to restore the world order. Certain rituals may have been strategic while having specific uses. Functionalism is seen by Hevia as chauvanism, which the author rejects as misunderstanding Qing's understanding of rituals function: social science and hindsight gives us better insight than the 1800s Qing Court. Maccartney was judged more on ritual than scientific insights or hope to increase trade. Hevia's argument of failure not being due to misunderstanding cross-culturally fails: the Qing were too obsessed with ritual over legitimate attempts to foster diplomacy and trade. Hevia believes that historiography must be concerned over where it places itself with power. This frees the historian to play loose with sources. Social science "objectivist" models are seen to privilege the West, with scholarship critical of the Qing seeming to promote imperialism. Chinese scholarship in accordance with the European view is auto-Orientalizing, not valid. Hevia critiques modernity, Chinese authors view Qianlong's refusal to modernize as a missed opportunity. Critique of all modernization is put under operating under a colonial framework, a dangerous precedent.

## Review review: Postpolemical Historiography
Esherick wishes to see the status quo, only seeing new scholarship as worthy with new sources. Postmodernism deflected from addressing the book's arguments. China Centered history has stopped viewing early modern China as stagnant and started seeing it highly active. Esherick brushes away these developments and post-colonialist scholarship as "post-modernism" (does he? Don't think that more schools of thought helps). Knowledge and texts are constructed by the historian, including, by creating a shared vocabulary, in translation. Narrative, epistimeology, and translation have to be deeply considered. He sought to break up dichotomies and to create a balanced account (this is coming in with an agenda). Centering was seen throughout Qianlong's interactions. As Guest Ritual takes a central stage, changes in it signal geopolitical changes. Making conflict seem inevitable leads to imperialism appologia (so what? if that is the actual interpretation). Social Science generalizes phenomena, humanities sees them as unique (call me a social scientist).

## Review review review: Tradutore, Traditore
The exchange places postmodernism's role in the historical phenomena at the forefront. Western scholars have placed postcolonial theory into China, never a colony, these approaches are putting Western approaches onto China (general framework, think that's weak). The author does not believe in scholarly status-quo or the need for new sources, he meerly believes in social science theory. Hevia deconstructs dichotomies but makes one between his theory and the conventional account: attack on him means defending the status quo (zing!). Hevia sees certain thoguht leaders as making the author's work theoretically untenable, a gatekeeping process. Translation is seen as a process of destabilizing the connection between facts and interpretation. Hevia uses this generous amount of translation liberty to bend the sources (siyi not having barbarian connotations for instance). Young scholars may be influenced by this.

## Analysis of Spat
Highly convinced by Esherick. Hevia seems to be very deconstructionist, and I am really not convinced by his translations. Hevia seems to decouple facts with knowledge and is explictly making a pro-Qing, anti-Imperialist tome. If this is knowledge creation, it is partisan. I believe Esherick in his positivist defence as well.
