# Cherishing Men from Afar, Qing Guest Ritual and the Macartney Embassy Of 1793

## Introduction
The British Lord Macartney visited the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] emperor eager to demonstrate his respect to Chinese customs and ideas. Instead of kowtowing, he kneeled, and presented a gift to the emperor, receiving a jade scepter in return. This study attempts to view this not as a turning point per-se of the Qing Dynasty, but rather in the light of modern developments of [[Asian Colonization]] and imperialism, and viewing Qing change through the light of internal factors.
Anti-colonial and feminist movements reevaluated imperialism away from purely economic explanations, influenced by new [[Marxism|Marxist]] narratives. Included were gender dynamics in colonialism, the impact of fiction as a narrative-building tool, intersectionality of gender, class, and race in constructing colonial identity, with groups such as the [[Subaltern Group]] revolutionizing imperialist thought. Representation in the process of building knowledge is a major focal point, as it is a crucial source of knowledge itself: it is what is being observed. European gaze and recording of foreign places informs much of European knowledge of the outside world, an ontological focus on vision as the primary organ of knowledge transmission. [[Orientalism]] has also influenced the conversation, arguing that knowledge of the Orient derives from its European domination, coming from a perspective of a superior European observer describing the Orient as it is. Orientalist representations in fact produced truth later, thus influencing reality and making their impact inescapable. The book is influenced by post-colonial and China area studies thought, with [[British Empire|British]], American, and Chinese representations as events in and of themselves.
