# Mozi
## Background
Mozi could be considered the first true philosopher of China, as he used reasoned critiques of primarily [[Confucianism|Confucian]] arguments.  He is notable for having an anti-aristocratic bent, stresing the duties of rulers often.  He also directly supported victims of injustice and defended cities being attacked.  He believes, first and foremost, in a unified, centralized, and stable government.  Instead of Confucian Ren, he stressed wealth, order, and population as utilitarian measures.  He also saw universal love as an alternative to filial piety.  His lack of importance on cultivating oneself and limiting desires leads him to a worldview much less centered on ritual as well.
## Chapter Summaries
### 8
Chaos and poverty are brought to realms with rulers who want to be successful.  This is due to a lack of meritocracy, those who are capable often do not rule.  Rulers should reward good men in order to get more, the end goal of a state.  The sage kings said not to associate with those who are not worthy.  Promoting righteousness makes those close to you not complacent, and thus more righteous themselves.  Those from any profession, technical and low included, can be successful if given power and they are righteous.

Benevolence is about promoting what is beneficial and rooting out what it is not, which is a crucially action-based conception of benevolence.  The greatest evil in the world is the strong taking advantage of the weak, be it people, families, or states.  These actions come about through partiality, or bias on behalf of some over others.  Thus, have impartial love, love others' families as much as your own.  Mozi also believes that impartiality is a practical construct for life, and that those who criticise impartiality would rather the world were, in fact, filled with those who treated themselves as they would their family, and would prefer leaders who put their subjects on equal footing to themselves.  Mozi then uses the sage kings as examples of impartial leaders, which proves that it is an actionable philosophy.  Furthermore, filial piety is bolstered by impartiality, as hoping for others to benefit your parents is filial.  People will also adapt to please their rulers, and thus a leader who demands impartiality will bolster impartiality in their realm.
