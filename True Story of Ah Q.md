# True Story of Ah Q
## Notes Reading
Shows the humiliation of a man with an ego, failure of the revolutionary class. Women ruin men according to Ah Q, like [[Water Margin]], which is not shown in the narrative. Importance of name and clan, carrying name with dishonor (compare with the [[Hong Kong]] clan temple I found in Yuen Long). Ah Q steals turnips and is almost overpowered by a dog, lowliness. Ah Q tried to get status by selling stolen goods, which failed. Ah Q fantasizes about who he would kill if he lead a revolution, which he previously admonished. Ah Q is excluded from the real revolution against the [[Qing Dynasty]], however. Revolutionary prestige outweighs imperial, and villagers don't understand the concept of liberty. Ah Q turns against the revolution after a final admonishment. Ah Q is exectued due to being an accomplice to a robbery (which he didn't participate in, he just wanted to), not even saying a line from an opera due to indecision: even his death was uncultured.
