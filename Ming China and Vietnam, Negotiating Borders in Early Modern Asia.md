# Ming China and Vietnam, Negotiating Borders in Early Modern Asia

## Introduction
The adoption of the name [[Vietnam]] originates from the [[Qing Dynasty]] dealing with the Nguyen Dynasty of [[Dai Viet]], seeking to be seen as Nan Yue (the same Yue of [[Guangxi]] and [[Guangdong]], Yueyu). This name was seen as irredentist to these territories of modern Southern China. In response, the Nguyen Dynasty threatened to cut off ties if the name was not accepted. As a compromise, the name Nan Yue was inverted, Yue Nan. The name Vietnam imposing a greater identity shows the importance of construction and forgetting the forging of national identity. Vietnam was a compromise as a name, not a Qing victory, taking as inspiration a rebellious Chinese state. Sinitic [[Confucianism|Confucian]] classics were at the heart of Vietnamese education and culture, with Vietnam accepting a tributary status. A joint identity flourished, with Vietnam viewing itself as a distinctly Southern outpost of a Chinese world. Regionalism and elite struggles divided internal opinion on foreign relations between Vietnam and the [[Ming Dynasty]], with the latter divided on whether [[Dai Viet]] was a lost colony or rebellious force. The goal of the book is to write a Sino-Vietnamese history which departs from nationalist historiography, an evolution of an increasingly independent, confident, an sinicized Vietnam interacting with Chinas that successively lost hope in reaquiring Vietnamese territory and responded by emphasizing difference between the two models. 

## A record of the dreams of an old southerner
Ho Nguyen Trun was a former prince of Dai Viet who worked as an official in the Ming Dynasty. His father briefly founded the Ho Dynasty, with Ming intervention leading to annexation, with Nguyen Trun rising high in Ming officialdom due to knowledge of gunpowder. [[Zhu Yuanzhang]], the Ming Dynasty's founder, sought no conflict in Vietnam, but [[Zhu Di]], his son, sought expansion there. The founding of the Ming Dynasty shook the [[Mongols|Mongol World Order]] by replacing the [[Yuan Dynasty]]. He wrote the Great Pronouncements, his views which he compared to the Sage Kings and which were not justified with the Confucian classics. He also invaded and settled [[Yunnan]], settled [[Guizhou]], and brought [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]] more in the Ming fold, ignoring lands beyond which were not seen as truly Chinese. In the [[Tributary System]], an inner Chinese realm hierarchically was given tribute by vassal kings, and gave gifts in return. Zhu saw a difference between friendly tributary states and the hostile Inner Asian groups. Conceptions of the Chinese World Order were informed by European conceptions of Chinese inability to enter interstate diplomacy. John Wills sees Ming diplomacy as flexible and not as rigid as conceived. Ritual hierarchy building must be laid on a foundation of mutual trust.
The Vietnamese were the first to recognize the Ming Dynasty, with the Korean [[Koryo Dynasty]] largely falling off of an inability to both recognize the Ming and not upset the nearby Mongols, turning into the [[Joseon Korea|Joseon Dynasty]]. Conceptions of Vietnam at the time showed it as a place without Confucian Rites and Music, less civilized and treacherous. The Tran Dynasty, largely under the influence of minister Ho Quy Ly, found ways of rejecting or minimizing tribute. Yuanzhang viewed Vietnam as non-Chinese, Zhu Di (Yongle) saw them as rebellious.
After a brief civil war, Yongle ascended the throne. He sponsored the outward looking [[Ming Treasure Voyages]]. Ho gained power amidst [[Champa]] invasion and declining prosperity. Ho Nguyen Trung was passed up as heir, as his brother was a descendent of the Tran Dynasty, content to support the dynasty. Ho Quy Ly tried to legitimize his rule by emphasizing a connection to its Chinese roots. Zhu Di recognized his rule. However, a claimant to the throne, Tran Thien Binh, told Zhu Di of Ho's assassination of the senior Tran ruler, which, on top of Vietnamese border unrest and taking of Champan Ming gifts, angered Zhu. Thien Binh was captured and executed en route to his Ming-recognized state. Yongle saw Ho as imitating Ming court ritual, an offense to their hegemon, especially when ruling over an illegitimate state, and thus Yongle went to war. The technological advantage in gunpowder is unknown: Ming later used Vietnamese experts but Vietnamese copies may have been based on Chinese technology, likely an exchange of ideas running both ways. The Ho royal family was captured quickly in 1407 and sent to [[Nanjing]]. Ming took control over Dai Viet, ignoring and killing Tran claimants. Traditional annals say that elite Vietnamese requested annexation after the death of the Tran, something that may have gone against Zhu Di's understanding of the Chinese world and would have been motivated as much by the idea that it was a waste to restore a dynasty seeing the human cost of the Ming invasion. A Ming general saw Dai Viet as part of China, and the elite Vietnamese acceptance may well have been true due to internal divisions. Le Loi restored Vietnamese independence, blamed on a cowardly general Wang Tong under emperor Zhu Zhanji in 1427. Le Loi embodied a non-coastal, anti-Ming sentiment, albeit accepted tributary status. 
Zhu Di, Ho Quy Ly, and Ho Nguyen Trung were all apparently Confucian, but Zhu defied his father in conquest, Ho Quy usurped the Tran, and Ho Nguyen worked for the enemy state. This did not lead the framework of filial piety to be questioned, however. Nguyen Trung preserved a dream of a Dai Viet changed, represented the good and not the bad, but was a key defender of its memory.

## The sparrow and the bamboo
Phung Khac Khoan travelled to [[Beijing]] to attempt to restore the title of king to Dai Viet. He was a staunch Le loyalist who hated Mac's compromise which put Dai Viet on par with borderland chieftains, a king turned into a "Pacification Commander". He attempted to raise the perception of Dai Viet's culture to conform to Sinitic Confucian culture, venerating the rites and [[Mengzi]]. Both Phung and Yi, a literary friend and representative of [[Joseon Korea]], privileged Confucianism over [[Buddhism]]. Yi played into Southern tropes, when Phung tried to emphasize shared culture. These meetings circulated Yi's Korean poems in Vietnam, a fact learned through the recordings of a prisoner captured by pirates (arrr). Phung used heavy allusions in poetry to flatter the Wanli emperor. He uses terms for China found in the classics which show it as central but borderless. The Wanli emperor initially refused the name change, trying to give a seal instead. This was again repeated, hoping to keep the Mac and Le in contest, as Dai Viet could not contest this. In Chinese texts, he is reported to be accompnied by "elders and chiefs," something not applied to Sinitic countries. 
In 1719, Nguyen Khoa Chiem wrote _Stories about the Achievements of the Southern Court_ to justify becoming king over the Le Dynasty. It unabashedly promotes Vietnamese greatness, a nightmare for the Qing Court (who may never have read it). Common stories were shared of a Vietnamese emissary destroying a fake sparrow to show that evil people should not stand atop gentlemen, thus destroying usurpers and gain the recognition from China. It postures that Dai Viet has not succumbed to vice like Ming China, a subtle sense of superiority over it. Even little Vietnam can stump mighty China, at least according to the Vietnamese.
