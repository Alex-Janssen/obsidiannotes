# Water Margin

## Overall Summary
Water Margin focuses on a quasi-historical rebellion against the Song Dynasty.  A corrupt general, Marshall Hong, disobays Daoist monks by treating their divine teacher with disrespect and ordering the opening of a chasm guarded by the monks said to contain demons.  108 demons were released, the Outlaws of the Marsh.  The Emperor is seen as picking poor officials, but officials are the antagonists of the book, not the emperor.
Lu Da meets a singing girl who is cruelly treated by a butcher, and in the process of allowing her familly to escape he kills this butcher, becoming a convict.  He gains amnesty in a Buddhist monestary due to connections stemming from the singing girl, but breaks the rules and threatens violence, and thus is sent away from the monestary as well.  He also meets Lin Chong, an arms instructor of the imperial guards, whose wife is being harrassed by the nephew of Gao, Lin Chong's superior.  Master Gao and sycophants repeatedly try to convince Lin Chong's wife that he is dead and coerce her, but she does not budge.  They put a warrant for Lin's arrest under the justification that he was forced to enter a government area with a weapon, an executable crime, however Lin is given a more leniant sentence and is allowed to go to exile.  Lin meets with a wealthy man and defeats his arms instructor, gaining respect.  As well, Lin Chong kills the sycophants after they set fire to the feedhouse in which he works; unbeknownst to them he was in a Daoist temple, and he takes their heads as sacrifice for the gods.
Song Jiang, leader of these marsh rebels, has a concubine Poxi who is in love with another, younger man.  When she learns of Song Jiang's involvement with the marsh bandits, she threatens to out Song Jiang if he allows him to marry the other man and get his gold.  However, Song Jiang is unable to give gold as he gave it to a man for charity even though he is willing to let her leave, and thus Song kills Poxi.  Poxi's mother sounds the alarm, and Song is, as well, on the run.
Wu Song is another outlaw whom Song Jiang meets, and Wu kills a tiger which has been haunting a county.  He becomes something of a folk hero, contrasted with his brother who is seen as weak.  Wu Song's brother's wife seeks help from a bawd, Mistress Wang, to have an affair with Ximen.  However, a younger boy, Yunge, is searching for Ximen and is stopped by Wang, and so he holds a grudge.  Eventually, Wu Song brother's wife, Pan, poisons him when he is ailing.  The coronoer knows this and cannot speak out due to Ximen's status, but keeps bone as proof.  However, when Wu Song hears of this from Yunge and Coroner Ho, he kills Pan and Ximen.  Wang is sentenced to death and Wu Song is sentenced to exile, where he is almost killed by a woman but whom he almost kills.  The woman's husband takes Wu Song in.
Yan Qing, a marsh bandit, goes to the imperial capital to gain amnesty for the group, who were offered unfair terms twice.  In doing so, he also seeks to expose Gao Qiu, a general, for hiding his failure.  In doing so, he meets a concubine Li Shishi, who is infatuated with Yan Qing.  In order to diffuse the flirtation, Yan Qing asks Li Shishi to be his blood sister, and they meet with the emperor, who was unaware of the injustice the marsh heroes faced and gave them amnesty.

## Translators Note
The story regards the end of Hui Zong's reign of the [[Song Dynasty]] in the early 1100s.  It concerns a small group of rebels who fight against tyranny.  Some events actually happened and some of these characters did exist, so it is somewhat historical in nature, and the story emerged from peasants and story tellers who were inspired and retold this story.  Shi Nai'an and Luo Guanzhong wrote a novel based on these folk tellings in the 14th century.  The ending depended on the reigning monarch, with some editions ending with the band still evading the government, and others with the outlaws becoming rebel-hunters themselves.  This translation is as close as possible to the text, preserving historical errors.  Also, some distinctly Chinese terms are rendered without an English equivalent.  The book is often seen to be written to justify the peasant uprising against the [[Yuan Dynasty]] by mirroring the revolt against Song emperor [[Song Huizong]]; the motivation for this revolt was to establish a native [[Han Dynasty]] against a foreign [[Mongols | Mongol]] one.


## Chapter Notes
### 1 Zhang Prays to Dispel a Plague, Marshall Hong Releases Demons by Mistake
##### Plot
Tai Zu, emperor, was God of Thunder on Earth who conquered and ruled 400 provinces/prefectures and was superior to any other in history, founding the Song Dynasty.
Marshall Zhao takes over, accepting abdication and establishing a dynasty.
Bao Zheng is a "star" of civil affairs, and Di Qing that of military.
After this, there was a prolonged period of peace and abundance.
A large plague swept through the entire country, swamping the court.
Greater than 50% of the population of the Eastern Capital died.
Due to the plague, all prisoners were released and taxes were cut.
Marshall Hong wants to consult with a monk, but he is unbothered by imperial politics and does not wish to see the edict (as told by other monks).
Daoists are rarely able to see this divine teacher, gaining such a oneness with the Dao.
Marshall Hong has to prove piety and live ascetic lifestyle in order to commune with the Divine Teacher.
Hong has to climb up mountain to meet the teacher, and finds that the trial is too onerous and beneath him.
Every time he doubts the mission, a dangerous animal thretens Hong's life, until he finally meets a poor boy playing the flute who tells him that the master has already been dispatched.
Hong blames the Daoists for these trials.
It turns out that the boy was the Divine Teacher, and Hong was assured that he was visitng but did not gain the boy's knowledge of the way.
Hong finds the supression of demons hall, where monks are sealing demons back from [[Tang Dynasty]] times.
Marshall Hong orders an abbot to open the hall to see a demon, and the abbot refuses; Hong doesn't believe that demons exist and think it is meant to be a conspicuous, false display of Daoist power.  Hong threatens the monks with exile and denouncement if they do not comply.
In the hall, there was written "Open when Hong comes."  Spooky!
Hong later wants stones overturned where the abbots believe the demons are sealed.
After all stones are removed, a pit a thousand feet deep is revealed and black smoke shoots out.
This released 108 demons onto the land which will cause trouble for the land; Hong later did not report this to the emperor.


##### Analysis
The chapter introduces itself with historic poetic verse, an interesting choice, tying itself to chronicles of the past.  Tai Zu is connected to the "Clouds dispers{ing}, reveal{ing} the sky," a fascinating way of saying that he brought clearness to the people considering he was the thunder god.
Why is [[Daoism]] seen as truth over Confucianism?  A Daoist monk endoerses Zhao and a Daoist is seen as the resolution to the plague.
Hong's climb has a lot to do with class, it is a lowering of himself.  Hong has to confront multiple dangerous animals, fast, and also note that a mere cowherd is on the same level as himself.

##### Questions
Why are historical figures seen as incarnations of spiritual figures?  Ren Zong and Tai Zu for instance.
How does Daoism interact with the ruling class?  The spiritual master being a rustic boy is an inversion of class hierarchy.
How do spirits interact with the Earth, seeing as they can take physical forms?
Does the [[Mandate of Heaven]] support these spirits, and revolt in general?

### 3 Master Shi Leaves Huiyan County at Night; Major Lu Pummles the Lord of the West
##### Plot
Zhu Wu, Shi Jin are introduced as bandits (those which come from the 108 spirits).
Shi Jin bests constables in fight, and they retreat.
Shi Jin is attempting to meet Wang Jin, a former teacher.
Shi Jin is known as "Nine Dragons"
Lu Da, receiveing Shi Jin, knows of him and Wang Jin, and points him to the right way.
Shi Jin met his first arms instructor too, Li Zhong, the "Tiger Fighting General."
Lu Da is angry when disturbed by spectators.
Master Zheng (a random butcher) took a girl as a concubine with a contract, but was driven out by the lord of the West's wife and he demanded repayment, and so she is singing for payment.
Li Zhong, Lu Da, and Shi Jin compete to give as much silver as possible to the family, and let them travel.
Lu Da confronts Zheng (after fighting off the inkeeper and the girl's attendant), asking for ridiculous cuts of meat and threw them in Zheng's face.  Zheng then attempts to stab Lu Da with a knife, and, after a fight, Lu Da mistakenly kills Zheng.  This leads to a warrant for his arrest, and the neighbors to the fight were beaten for failing to save Zheng.
Lu Da listens to an announcement that there is an award for his arrest.

##### Analysis
This immediately sets up the bandits as a formidible force.
Shi Jin is shown with humility, unlike Hong, showing an inclination toward the Mandate of Heaven.
The girl's story shows some traditional gender roles, having to repay when driven out.
Interesting that Lu Da is mentioned to have been illiterate.

##### Questions
How does the story of the girl and family interact with rebellion?  Outlaws are seen providing for the common person, while those with money and little power extract from them.
Why is the girl, after revealing her name, still always referred to as Jin's daughter?  Why did the outlaws only ask for Jin's family name?
How did the butcher, a useless oaf, get the titel Lord of the West?  Lu Da is able to claim this title but does not, how does this interact with [[Confucianism]]?


### 4 Sagacious Lu Puts Mount Wutai in an Uproar; Squire Zhao Repairs Wenshu Monastery.
##### Plot
A strange man (Old Jin) recognizes Lu Da and pulls him from the crowd.
Squire Zhao became the Jin's daughter's husband, and he is just.
After talking, a man on a horse finds Lu Da and calls for people to surround him, but Old Jin convinces them to disperse, this man turns out to be Squire Zhao.
The squire, who is higher rank than Lu Da, is differential to him.
Zhao invites Lu Da to his manor, which is safer than the county capital.
Police were in Old Jin's neighborhood looking for Lu Da, and so the whole region is dangerous after a week of staying in Zhao's manor.
Zhao knows an abbot in Mount Wutai's monestary, and wants Lu to become a Buddhist monk.
Lu commits many faux pas in the process to become a monk.
The Master accepts Lu Da, but does not believe that Lu Da has the makings of a monk.
The abbot consents, saying that Lu Da represents a star in heaven and that no other monk is his equal.
Lu Da wished to maintain his beard, but that is not allowed; after the ceremony he was given the Buddhist name Sagacious.
Squire Zhao asks for the monks to forgive Lu for future misgivings as a favor.
Lu refuses to learn to meditate and wants different food than he is given.
After 5 months, Lu is tired of this ascetic lifestyle and abiding by the five precepts (including not drinking).
Lu attacked a man for not giving him wine, and, after getting drunk, is warned that he will be beaten and expelled if he hangs around drunk, in response he threatens those who warn him.
30 monks surround Lu after he slaps a gatekeeper, but Lu approaches the abbot.
Many monks want to expel Lu, but the abbot wishes to see him become a saint.
Lu lets his hair grow, a sin, and again goes to a market town to get drink.
Lu lied to get wine, saying he was a visiting monk.
Lu accidentally breaks a post, alerting the gate keepers that he was drunk and so they locked the monastery.
Lu breaks two idols of Buddha.  The abbot continues to allow Lu's antics.
At this point, two hundred monks and staffmembers attacked an unarmed Lu.
Lu was transferred away from the monastery to another (due to the Zhao connection) due to interrupting monks during meditation, the first disruption of Mount Wutai's tranquility since Wenshu Buddha meditated there.
The monk tells Lu Da a prophecy to "halt at the river"(chapter five).

##### Analysis
Old Jin and the daughter are fiercly loyal to Lu Da, a manifestation of the Mandate of Heaven's growth of discontent among the populace.
Lu Da is forced to humble himself with this foreign Buddhist tradition, and is obviously not used to Buddhist tradition.
Lu, even after this treatment, still uses violence, in this case to get wine from the seller and to threaten the monks who say he will be expelled.  Even after the second outing, Lu gets caught by breaking a post; violence is always what undos him.
The constant questioning of Lu with the abbot protecting him reminds me of the "Old Man Lose Horse" story (Saiweng Shi Ma).
The monastery sponsers all alcohol shops, and so they can't sell to monks.


##### Questions
Why is there this transition from Daoism to [[Buddhism]]?  What is the interplay between the two traditions in the text?
There seems to be a repetition of faults, both in Lu searching drink and Hong's climb to meet the master, why?

### 7 The Tatooed Monk Uproots a Willow Tree, Lin Chong Enters White Tiger Sanctum by Mistake
##### Plot
There are 2 leaders of 23 knaves, rat crossing the street  Zhang the 3rd(the greatest title in literary history) and snake in the grass Li the 4th.  Although seemingly coming to concradulate Lu and company, Lu is suspicious.
Lu preemptively attacked, but then let the gang come to leaders' rescue.
They destroy a crows nest, an omen that a fight will start.
Lu was able to uproot a tree with his hand.
Lin Chong, an arms instructor of the Imperial Guards, is impressed with Lu.  Lin Chong becomes a sworn brother of Lu on the spot.
Lin Chong has a wife, who is harassed by Master Gao, adopted son of the commander of these Imperial Guards.
Lu Da offers to get revenge on Master Gao.
Master Gao still wants to coerce Lin Chong's wife, Fu Da comes up with a plan.
Master Gao comes up with an elaborate, sexist plot to get Lin Chong's wife.
Lu Qian calms Lin Chong about Gao.
Master Gao tries to convince Lin Chong's wife that Lin is dead, and Master Gao says to her that "her true husband has arrived."
Lin Chong was not raped, but was threatened.
Lu Qian was plotting against Lin, Lin tries to kill Lu Qian.
Sycophants still convince Gao that he will marry Lin Chong's Wife.
Fu An convinces the marshal and Commander Gao to order Lin Chong's death.
Lin Chong buys a fancy sword.
The Marshal wants to "compare swords" with Lin Chong.
Lin Chong goes to the White Tiger Inner Sanctum where top military matters are discussed.
This is a trap, entering the Sanctum with a weapon is punishable by death.

##### Analysis
Loyalty often derives from strength, Lu command loyalty after beating leaders and uprooting tree.  Is this a justification for a mandate of heaven, if Han can beat the Yuan militarily then they deserve to rule China and gain loyalty?
Sexism is rampant, after saying that Lin Chong's husband is dead, Fu Da's plan is that Master Gao will seem so handsome that she will marry him?  Men have complete control over women in this society.
Women still are not referred to by name
Gao = 高, he is personification of Huizong, high in status and corrupt.

##### Questions
What do titles mean?  How were they given and what symbolism do they hold?
Why does Lu Da always mention his killings?  Why does he feel the need to maintain honesty about his past?
Why, after Lin Chong's wife is harassed, is Master Gao seen as sympathetic, and it was only wrong because it was Lin Chong's wife?  How are women treated in ancient China?
Why is the only justification to kill Lin Chong through entrapment?  Is this seen as corrupt government, wheras the rebels often tell the truth?
Why does every chapter end with "read the next chapter if you'd like to know?"

### 8 Arms Instructor Lin is Tatooed and Exiled to Cangzhou; Sagacious Lu Makes a Shambles of Wild Boar Forest
##### Plot

A kind scribe also vouches for Lin's innocence.
As an intermediary, Lin is given physical punishment and is exiled where Gao does not have power.

An anullment is drafted, but the father says he will not allow daughter to remarry.
Lu Qian returns, intercepting the exile and hoping for the guards to assassinate Lin; they accept.
One of the guards berates Lin (the one who accepted the assassination), the other is quite kind.
After Xue, mean guard, purposely burns Lin's feet, Dong, the nicer one, helps him.
They reach a treacherous Wild Boar Forest.
The guards bound up Lin, and then attempt to kill him.

##### Analysis
The novel directly addresses the reader, a fascinating metaawarness for a book of this time period.
Lin Chong treats his wife decently, prizing her safety and autonomy.
Anullment is between husband and father in law, wife has no say.
Even the text explain archaic terms such as the golden print meaning prisoner's tattoo.

##### Questions
Why is Zhang, Lin Chong's father in law, so hesitant to allow his daughter to remmary?

### 9 Chai Jin Keeps Open House for All Bold Men; Lin Chong defeats Instructor Hong in a Bout with Staves

Lin Chong is left alone in relative safety, stumbles upon a bar under the influence of a well protected man Chai Jin who is welcoming to bold men.  Chai Jin supports exiled prisoners.
Chai is not present in his manor, instead he is out hunting, but they encounter each other on the road.
Chai's arms instructor enters and does not return Lin Chong's greeting.  He doesn't trust Lin, and thinks that Chai is being gullible.
They agree to a staff duel, Lin initially declines but this makes Chai order the duel to happen.
Lin tries to lose in order to maintain Chai's reputation.  Chai offers a cash prize and frees Lin temporarily, and so take it as a cue to win.
Chai celebrates Lin's victory and Chai gives Lin a letter addressed to the prefect of Cangzhou ensuring good treatment.
Lin goes to prison and bribes the warden after they curse him out, after which the warden completely changes tone.
Lin is upset how effective bribes are, and is spared of the beating and is given an easy job.

##### Analysis
The novel also pushes Buddhism and Daoism as essentials for virtue.
Inversion of hierarchy, the monk imposes arbitrary punishments on the unjust guards, which inverts the class dynamic.
Chai Jin also inverts hierarchy, feeling esteemed to be in Lin Chong's presence due to past glory.

##### Questions
Why are monks so often the focal points for good actions?
How important are formalities?  Face seems to be central, but how much of the plot revolves around reputation?
Why are the rebels so often protected by the upper class?  Twice letters have played a key role in protecting the main characters for consequences.
Why are henchmen so often evil?  The guards, Fu An, the earliest marshal, and warden are all evil and are subservient.  The marshal even admits to treating those without money worse.

Lin threatens an older man for wine.
Lin Chong was later taken by a large number of vassals to an unknown location.

##### Analysis
Hospitality is crucial.  Convicts and those who are mistreated always find someone who they can be supported by.
Lu Qian seems to be a recurring character, a sort of nemesis.

##### Questions
How realistic are these social networks?  How much of a role does honor play in this novel?  Why are year-long favors remembered?
The snowstorm is seen to be an act of the gods to protect Lin Chong, can other events be seen like this?

Tang slapped Yan for yelling this, Tang was imprisoned for this offence but Song was not pursued due to his status.

##### Analysis
Girl is shown as annoying, a baggage instead of actually having emotions.  This is from her own mother too.
Poxi is practically treated as livestock, Yan is not mortified by her death.

Why is the mother so anti-Poxi?  Why does she always take Song Jiang's position?

Interesting that a "real man" is not destracted by lust.

Why does the emperor refer himself as "Xuanhuo the Daoist sovreign?"
